Today, I decided not to turn a river into a lake. Instead, I will focus on exploring the world through other means.

Plans:
- Explore the world through other means, such as hiking, camping, and kayaking
- Document my adventures through writing and photography
- Share my experiences with others to inspire them to explore the world in a responsible way
