A river flows, forever on its way,
Through valleys deep and mountains grey,
Its gentle current, a soothing sound,
As it winds its way around and around.

The water rushes, swift and strong,
As it carries with it, the birds' sweet song,
The fish that swim, the leaves that fall,
All swept along, in the river's thrall.

The river's beauty, a sight to behold,
Its sparkling waters, a sight so bold,
A source of life, for all around,
The river's magic, forever unbound.
