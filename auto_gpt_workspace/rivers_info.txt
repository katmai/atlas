A river is a natural flowing watercourse that usually flows towards another body of water at a lower elevation, such as an ocean, sea, bay, lake, wetland, or another river. They cover only around 0.1% of the land on Earth and serve crucial ecological functions by providing and feeding freshwater habitats for aquatic and semiaquatic fauna and flora. Rivers are significant to humankind since many human settlements and civilizations are built around sizeable rivers and streams. They are depended upon as a vital source of drinking water, for food supply via fishing and agricultural irrigation, for shipping, as natural borders and/or defensive terrains, as a source of hydropower to drive machinery or generate electricity, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste. Rivers can be modified or controlled for human purposes, but these modifications can also have negative impacts on the environment and human communities. Despite these challenges, rivers remain important natural resources that provide numerous benefits to human societies and ecosystems.
