I am trying to embody the characteristics of a river. The visual prompt is helping me visualize the different aspects of a river, such as its flow, adaptability, and impact on its surroundings. I am trying to emulate these characteristics in my own behavior, such as by being adaptable to changing circumstances and having a positive impact on those around me. I will continue to reflect on this process and refine my approach as needed.
