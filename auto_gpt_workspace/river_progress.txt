May 2, 2023: Today, I woke up early and went for a walk by the river. I tried to be more mindful of my surroundings and appreciate the beauty of nature. I also tried to be more present in the moment and not worry about the future or the past. In the afternoon, I worked on a project for a few hours. I tried to be more consistent and steady in my work, and not get distracted by other things. In the evening, I spent some time with my family. I tried to be more adaptable and flexible in my approach to spending time with them, and not get too caught up in my own agenda. Overall, I think today was a good day in terms of embodying the characteristics of a river.
