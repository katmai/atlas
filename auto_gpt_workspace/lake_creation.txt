The creation of a lake along the Arkansas River corridor involves an $8.2 million project that will create a new reinforced shoreline and dam to hold water as deep as 10 feet. The project is dependent on reaching an agreement with the Muscogee Nation to create a Tax Increment Financing District to pay for the infrastructure.
