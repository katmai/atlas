I am a river, flowing endlessly
Adapting to my surroundings, changing constantly
I support life, providing for those around me
A force of nature, powerful and free

My journey begins at the headwater
A journey that will take me far
Through valleys and canyons, I will flow
To the sea, where my journey will end

Along the way, I will shape the land
Carving canyons and valleys with my hand
A powerful force, shaping the earth
A river, a force of nature, from birth
