To be a river means to be a natural stream of water with defined banks, nourished by precipitation, direct overland runoff, springs and seepages, or meltwater at the edges of snowfields and glaciers. Rivers are important for early human settlements, trade, agriculture, and industry, but their use can also cause environmental problems.
