A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases, a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Rivers have been important in human history and culture for thousands of years, and they continue to be important today for transportation, irrigation, and as a source of power.
