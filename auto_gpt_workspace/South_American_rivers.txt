Notable rivers in South America include the Amazon, Río de la Plata, Orinoco, and São Francisco. The Amazon is the largest river in the world by volume of water and drains about two-fifths of South America. Lake Titicaca is the largest Andean lake, while the Pantanal is a vast marshy area in the middle course of the Paraguay River. Soils in South America vary widely in fertility, with fertile soils covering only about 10% of the continent's surface. The climate of South America is diverse, with tropical conditions prevailing over more than half of the continent and elevation being an important climatic control.
