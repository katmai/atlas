The river_ecology_agent provided the following information on the ecological functions of rivers and their impact on the environment:

1. Transporting nutrients and sediment: Rivers transport nutrients and sediment from the mountains to the sea, which helps to maintain the fertility of the land and the health of marine ecosystems.

2. Providing habitat: Rivers provide habitat for a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial species, including fish, birds, mammals, and insects.

3. Regulating water flow: Rivers help to regulate the flow of water in ecosystems, which is important for maintaining water quality, reducing the risk of floods and droughts, and supporting the growth of plants and animals.

4. Filtering pollutants: Rivers act as natural filters, removing pollutants and contaminants from the water and improving water quality.

5. Supporting human activities: Rivers provide water for drinking, irrigation, and industrial uses, as well as recreational opportunities like fishing, boating, and swimming.

It is important to manage rivers in a sustainable way to ensure their continued ecological function and the health of the environment.
