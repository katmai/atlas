A river is a natural flowing watercourse that usually flows towards another waterbody at a lower elevation, and can be freshwater or saline. Rivers are important for the water cycle and provide habitats for aquatic and semiaquatic fauna and flora. They are also significant to human settlements and civilizations. They can also be threatened by man-made causes such as pollution and over-exploitation.
