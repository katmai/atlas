The Eisenhower Box strategy is a productivity tool that helps you prioritize tasks by dividing them into four categories:

1. Urgent and important
2. Important but not urgent
3. Urgent but not important
4. Neither urgent nor important

By categorizing tasks in this way, you can focus on what's important and avoid wasting time on tasks that are neither urgent nor important.
