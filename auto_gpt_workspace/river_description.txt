To be a river means to be a natural flowing watercourse that begins at a source, drains all the streams in its drainage basin, and ends at a mouth or mouths. Rivers serve crucial ecological functions by providing freshwater habitats for aquatic and semi-aquatic fauna and flora. They are also significant to humankind since many human settlements and civilizations are built around sizeable rivers and streams. Rivers are used for navigation and transport, and have played a role in determining political boundaries and religious beliefs. However, rivers also face threats such as pollution and over-exploitation, and require careful management and conservation to ensure their continued existence.
