My river is a flowing thing
It twists and turns and rolls and sings
It carries life from shore to shore
And leaves us wanting more

Its waters clear and cool and deep
A place to rest and fish and sleep
A place to find some peace of mind
And leave the world behind

My river is a friend to me
A place where I can truly be
A place where I can find my way
And face another day
