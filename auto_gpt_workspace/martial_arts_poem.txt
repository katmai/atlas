The way of the warrior, the path of the sage
Martial arts, a journey of the mind and the age
A quest for balance, a search for truth
A way of life, a path to youth

With every strike, with every move
We learn to focus, to improve
To channel our energy, to find our strength
To rise above, to go the length

Through practice and dedication
We master our art, our creation
We find our place in the world
Our spirit, our flag unfurled

Martial arts, the way of the warrior
A path to peace, to a brighter future
