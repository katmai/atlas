Rivers are an important source of fresh water for drinking and irrigation in agriculture. They also provide transportation, hydroelectricity, and leisure activities like swimming and boating. Rivers deposit sediment in floodplains, which are highly fertile agricultural zones that offer tremendous value to the surrounding people. Rivers support a biodiverse habitat and distribute important salts and nutrients to support plant and animal life. Overall, rivers play a significant role in shaping the physical and cultural landscapes of the world and are essential for human survival and development.
