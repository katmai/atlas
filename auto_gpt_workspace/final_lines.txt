The river's banks, a lush green scene,
A place of peace, where one can dream,
The trees that line its winding course,
A natural wonder, a powerful force.

The river's journey, a never-ending tale,
As it flows through the land, without fail,
A symbol of life, of hope and of grace,
A river's beauty, impossible to replace.

The river's path, a journey of its own,
A constant motion, a rhythm unknown,
A force of nature, that will never cease,
A river's magic, a true masterpiece.
