Rivers flow
Through mountains and valleys below
Their currents strong
Their depths unknown

They support life
In all its forms
From fish to fowl
And plants adorned

Their waters clean
Their banks lush
Rivers are nature's
Gift to us

May we cherish
And protect them so
For without rivers
Where would life go?
