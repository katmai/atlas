Resources on what it means to be a river:

- A river is a body of water that flows downhill due to gravity. It can be wide or shallow and may flow year-round or seasonally. Rivers can be thousands of miles long and have a starting point called a headwater and an endpoint called a mouth where it empties into a larger body of water. The erosional power of rivers can create geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon.
- Rivers are natural streams of water with defined banks that can be nourished by precipitation, overland runoff, springs and seepages, or meltwater at the edges of snowfields and glaciers. River water losses result from seepage, percolation into aquifers, and evaporation. Rivers are important for early human settlements, trade, agriculture, and industry, but can also cause environmental problems. The text also discusses the distribution, drainage patterns, and geometry of river systems, as well as the formation of fluvial landforms and the processes involved.
