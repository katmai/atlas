A natural wonder, a powerful force.
The river's banks, a lush green scene,
A place of peace, where one can dream,


A force of nature, that will never cease,
The trees that line its winding course,
The river's journey, a never-ending tale,
A river's magic, a true masterpiece.
A symbol of life, of hope and of grace,
A river's beauty, impossible to replace.
As it flows through the land, without fail,
The river's path, a journey of its own,
A constant motion, a rhythm unknown,
