After researching the characteristics of a river, I want to embody those qualities. Some ways I can do that include:
- Flowing downhill towards my goals and dreams
- Adapting to changing circumstances and environments
- Providing nourishment and support to those around me
- Carving my own path through life
- Carrying important knowledge and wisdom with me
- Providing energy and power to others
- Finding joy and beauty in the journey
