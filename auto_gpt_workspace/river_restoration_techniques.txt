discussing the evolution, challenges, and limitations of river restoration techniques in Europe, with a focus on maintaining ecological balance, increasing biodiversity, and improving water quality. The importance of considering natural processes and dynamic flow regimes is emphasized, and successful case studies are presented. The text also suggests a shift towards larger-scale projects and a focus on hyporheic processes, riparian zones, floodplains, and backwaters, and emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches and post-project evaluation and monitoring. The greatest threats to progress are human population growth and climate change.
