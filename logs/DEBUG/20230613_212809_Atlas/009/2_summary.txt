"I received a message to execute Python code to compare vacation options based on cost, distance, and rating. However, the code returned an error due to a missing argument. I was then instructed to write data to a file called \"options.txt\" and execute a new Python file called \"calculate_best_option.py\". However, the file could not be found on my computer. I received a message to list files in the current directory, but the file was still not found."
