"I received an action result message from my computer, indicating an error with the \"get_hyperlinks\" command. The assistant acknowledged the mistake and provided a new plan, which involves using the \"get_hyperlinks\" command without the \"question\" argument to search for links to the \"calculate_best_option.py\" file on the website. The computer then returned a list of hyperlinks from the website."
