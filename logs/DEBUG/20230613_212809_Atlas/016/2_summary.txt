"I used the \"browse_website\" command to search for the \"calculate_best_option.py\" file on Google, but the search only returned a webpage with information about Google's use of cookies and data. The webpage contained links to accessibility options, language settings, and Google policies. There was no information about a specific file available for download. I then used the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to retrieve hyperlinks from the webpage, but the results only included links to Google login, cookie policy, privacy policy, and terms of service pages."
