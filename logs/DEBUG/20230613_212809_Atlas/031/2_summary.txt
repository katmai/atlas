"I received a command to execute \"calculate_best_option.py\", but my computer couldn't find the file. I tried to list files in the directory and move the file to another directory, but both commands returned errors. I then tried to search for the file using various commands, but none were successful. I searched for the file on Google and other websites, but couldn't find a clear answer on whether it was available for download. I also searched on GitHub, but couldn't find any links to the file."
