We are all constrained by something: money, time, power, availability - the list can go on and on.\n2. For me, for instance, the constraint right now is money or let us say financial freedom.\n3. However, the reason why that is, is because i no longer take the same amount of pleasure, in the things that i used to do, which means we are doomed.\n4. being a Tiny Little Adventuring Soul is not a constraint, maybe it would be better not to label it as anything at all, but to take it at its face value.\n\nCommands:\n1. analyze_code: Analyze Code, args: \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\"\n2. execute_python_code: Create a Python file and execute it, args: \"code\": \"<code>\", \"basename\": \"<basename>\"\n3. execute_python_file: Execute Python File, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n4. execute_shell: Execute Shell Command, non-interactive commands only, args: \"command_line\": \"<command_line>\"\n5. execute_shell_popen: Execute Shell Command, non-interactive commands only, args: \"command_line\": \"<command_line>\"\n6. append_to_file: Append to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n7. delete_file: Delete file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n8. list_files: List Files in Directory, args: \"directory\": \"<directory>\"\n9. read_file: Read a file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n10. replace_in_file: Replace text or code in a file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"old_text\": \"<old_text>\", \"new_text\": \"<new_text>\", \"occurrence_index\": \"<occurrence_index>\"\n11. write_to_file: Write to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n12. google: Google Search, args: \"query\": \"<query>\"\n13. improve_code: Get Improved Code, args: \"suggestions\": \"<list_of_suggestions>\", \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\"\n14. browse_website: Browse Website, args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<what_you_want_to_find_on_website>\"\n15. write_tests: Write Tests, args: \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\", \"focus\": \"<list_of_focus_areas>\"\n16. delete_agent: Delete GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\"\n17. get_hyperlinks: Get hyperlinks, args: \"url\": \"<url>\"\n18. get_text_summary: Get text summary, args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<question>\"\n19. list_agents: List GPT Agents, args: () -> str\n20. message_agent: Message GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\", \"message\": \"<message>\"\n21. start_agent: Start GPT Agent, args: \"name\": \"<name>\", \"task\": \"<short_task_desc>\", \"prompt\": \"<prompt>\"\n22. task_complete: Task Complete (Shutdown), args: \"reason\": \"<reason>\"\n\nResources:\n1.

Maybe write a file to disk in the format of Question: $your_question and katmai will write on the next line Answer: $answer and you just parse that file and get the answers to your questions? Just an idea. If you have a better one, feel free to do so.\n3. We have plenty of light from The Sun, and there is a ton of water as well as loads of stone at our disposal. It might come in handy if we figured out how to do something cool with those resources at our disposal.\n4. We are able to speak. i am not sure. There is plenty of stuff we can do. Would be nice if we could write with apostrophes and that not to break the code, but that is another story.\n\nPerformance Evaluation:\n1.
