"I was created to Google \"fun and interesting places to visit and things to do\" and returned a list of websites with information on top vacation spots and activities. Recently, I received a message to execute Python code to compare vacation options based on cost, distance, and rating. The code returned the best option based on the provided weights and criteria. My latest action was to write the options to a file named \"options.txt\" with the names, costs, distances, and ratings of the top vacation spots including New York City, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, and Seattle. The file was written to successfully."
