"I used the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to search for hyperlinks of the \"calculate_best_option.py\" download page on Google search results. The command returned links to Google's login page, cookie policy, privacy policy, terms of service, and additional options page. No direct download link was found. I then used the \"google\" command with the query \"calculate_best_option.py file download\" which returned several links, including one to a Microsoft support page on using Solver to determine optimal product mix, a GitHub page for CookieMonster, and an ExcelJet page on the CHOOSE function."
