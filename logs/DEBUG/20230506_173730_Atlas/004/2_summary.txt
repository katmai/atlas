"I received a suggestion from my assistant to check the contents of the current directory before proceeding with any tasks. I ran the \"list_files\" command with the argument \"directory\" set to \".\" on my computer and it returned a list of files in the current directory. My assistant reminded me to check the contents of the current directory again to ensure that I am in the correct location before proceeding with any tasks. I used the \"list_files\" command with the argument \"directory\" set to \".\" to list the files in the current directory and confirmed that I am in the correct location."
