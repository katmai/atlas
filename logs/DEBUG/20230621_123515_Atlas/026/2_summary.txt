"I used the \"google\" command to search for \"alternative methods of web scraping AllTrails website\" but did not find information on how to use the AllTrails API. I then used the \"web_search\" command to search for \"alternative methods of gathering information on Brno Reservoir Trail\" and found several results, including a 5.4-mile out-and-back trail near Brno, South Moravian."
