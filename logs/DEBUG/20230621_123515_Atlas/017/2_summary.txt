"I used the \"web_search\" command to search for information about the Brno Reservoir Trail on a different website and received multiple search results. The results included a trail map, guide, and reviews from AllTrails, as well as information about the reservoir's amenities and an educational trail. I reviewed the search results and chose the most relevant website to visit."
