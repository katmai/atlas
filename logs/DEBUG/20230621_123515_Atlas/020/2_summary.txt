"I used the \"web_search\" command to search for information about the Brno Reservoir Trail on a different website and received multiple search results. The results included a trail map, guide, and reviews from AllTrails, as well as information about the reservoir's amenities and an educational trail. I reviewed the search results and chose the most relevant website to visit. The \"web_search\" command returned multiple results, including a 2.9-mile educational trail, and a 5.4-mile out-and-back trail map and guide from AllTrails. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to visit the website of the city of Brno to find out about the different hiking trails available at the Brno Reservoir, but the website returned an error message stating that the requested page cannot be found."
