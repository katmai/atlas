"I wrote a packing list for the Brno Reservoir Trail using the \"write_to_file\" command and received confirmation that the file was successfully written. I then used the \"read_file\" command to confirm the contents of the packing list. The list includes hiking boots, water bottle, snacks, sunscreen, insect repellent, first aid kit, map, compass, hat, sunglasses, extra clothing, rain gear, headlamp or flashlight, emergency whistle, multi-tool or knife, and cash or credit card. I now need to pack these supplies for the trip."
