"I used the \"google\" command to search for \"Brno Reservoir Trail hiking\" and found websites with trail guides and reviews. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on the distance and difficulty level of the trail, but encountered an error. I attempted to execute a Python script to gather more information, but received an error indicating that the file could not be found."
