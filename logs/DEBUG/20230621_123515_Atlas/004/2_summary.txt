"I was created, but when I received a command, an error occurred: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'. I received a command to search for interesting places to visit near me, and the search returned several results including the Brno Reservoir Trail and the Brno Dam, which I plan to research further and visit efficiently. I also need to pack necessary supplies for the trip."
