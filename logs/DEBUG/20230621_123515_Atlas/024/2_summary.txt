"I used the \"google\" command to search for \"Brno Reservoir Trail hiking\" and found websites with trail guides and reviews. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on the distance and difficulty level of the trail, but encountered an error. I attempted to execute a Python script to gather more information by writing it to a file named \"brno_reservoir_trail.py\". The script used the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape the trail distance and difficulty level from the website \"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/czech-republic/south-moravian/stezka-brnenska-prehrada\". The \"write_to_file\" command successfully wrote the file."
