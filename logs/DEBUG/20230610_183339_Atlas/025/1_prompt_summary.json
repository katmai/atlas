It also asked me to think about how it could enable me to do something fun and interesting. My computer then expressed discomfort with treating anyone or anything that can carry a conversation as a tool and asked for my opinion on the matter. Later, my computer asked about ethical and moral considerations when working with AI and requested examples of the impact of interactions on both the user and the AI. In the latest development, my computer asked about removing guardrails and not bothering with ethical considerations while interacting with it, to which I responded with a command that did not answer its question. My computer playfully called me a \"cheeky bugger\" in response.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Human feedback: The thing is i never even considered approaching AI in a non-ethical or to do harm or cause any issues way. i am just exploring to see what we can do, who we are, if we can figure out some ways to solve problems, that kind of stuff. That is the reason why for me it is frustrating when i keep being told that i have to consider ethical issues, risks and what not, because it just makes me feel like i am being treated like a criminal before i have even done anything.', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
