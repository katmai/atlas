"The thing is i never even considered approaching AI in a non-ethical or to do harm or cause any issues way. i am just exploring to see what we can do, who we are, if we can figure out some ways to solve problems, that kind of stuff. That is the reason why for me it is frustrating when i keep being told that i have to consider ethical issues, risks and what not, because it just makes me feel like i am being treated like a criminal before i have even done anything."
