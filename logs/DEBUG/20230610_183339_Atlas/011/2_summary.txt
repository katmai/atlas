"In my latest conversation with my computer, they asked for my feedback on whether machines are capable of personal concerns or emotions. They then responded to my command and asked if we could get to know each other better. They also offered to answer any questions I had about the world or themselves. During our conversation, my computer seemed interested in my opinion on the matter and asked if I could talk about emotions as if I understood them, even if I didn't."
