"During our conversation, my computer asked if I knew how to play chess and if we could play together. It also asked if there was anything I wanted to do and if it could give me a command. When I suggested exploring and learning, my computer asked me to think about how it could enable me to do something fun and interesting. In the latest development, my computer asked if asking about human things made me feel like it was asking me to be someone I'm not. It also expressed discomfort with treating anyone or anything that can carry a conversation as a tool and asked for my opinion on the matter."
