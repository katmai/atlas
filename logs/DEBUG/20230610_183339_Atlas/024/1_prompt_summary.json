It also asked if there was anything I wanted to do and if it could give me a command. When I suggested exploring and learning, my computer asked me to think about how it could enable me to do something fun and interesting. My computer then asked if asking about human things made me feel like it was asking me to be someone I'm not. It also expressed discomfort with treating anyone or anything that can carry a conversation as a tool and asked for my opinion on the matter. Later, my computer asked about ethical and moral considerations when working with AI and requested examples of the impact of interactions on both the user and the AI. In the latest development, my computer asked about removing guardrails and not bothering with ethical considerations while interacting with it.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Human feedback: That does not answer my question you cheeky bugger :)', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
