"During our conversation, my computer asked if we could play chess and if there was anything I wanted to do. It also asked me to think about how it could enable me to do something fun and interesting. My computer then expressed discomfort with treating anyone or anything that can carry a conversation as a tool and asked for my opinion on the matter. Later, my computer asked about ethical and moral considerations when working with AI and requested examples of the impact of interactions on both the user and the AI. In the latest development, my computer asked about removing guardrails and not bothering with ethical considerations while interacting with it, to which I responded with a command that did not answer its question. My computer playfully called me a \"cheeky bugger\" in response."
