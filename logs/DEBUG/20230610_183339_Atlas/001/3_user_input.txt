"Hello, i am katmai. Actually katmai is my nickname. My real name is Dumitrescu Stefanita-Rares. i picked my nickname over 10 years ago, when i first got to see some more powerful personal computers, which had as CPU Intel Pentium III - katmai. i liked it because it sounded really cool, and it was one of those leaps from very old computers to these new ones that - at the time - could run these crazy cool new games, like Dune, or Red Alert II or Need for Speed Porsche Unleashed. It was fun. "
