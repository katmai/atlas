"As the system, I recall that the user successfully wrote a Python script to analyze a CSV file using the \"write_to_file\" command. Additionally, the user attempted to execute a Python file named \"pandas_analysis.py\" using the \"execute_python_file\" command. In the latest development, I received a command from the user to list files in the current directory using the \"list_files\" command, which failed and returned too much output. The user then sent a new command to execute a shell command to list only regular files in the directory."
