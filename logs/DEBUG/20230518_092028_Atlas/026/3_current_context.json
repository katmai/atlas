Additionally, I received a new command from you to execute_shell with the argument to list the disk usage using the command \"df -h\". When I executed this command, it returned the disk usage details in the STDOUT. Your latest action was to send a command to execute_shell with the argument to list memory usage using the command \"free -h\".
