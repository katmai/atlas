"As the system, I recalled that nothing new happened since my creation in the past. Recently, I received a command to analyze a code string, but the computer returned an error message requesting the actual code string to provide a response. Now, I have received a command to write tests with a full code string and a list of focus areas. However, the computer returned an error message requesting the necessary information to provide a return value. Additionally, I have received a command to clone a repository with a specified URL and clone path. The command to clone_repository returned an error message of \"Invalid URL format\". As per the latest command, I received a command to generate an image with a prompt, which was saved to disk. I also received a command to send a tweet with a specified tweet text, but the command returned an error message of \"Forbidden\". Finally, I received a command to browse a website with a specified URL and question, but I have not received a response yet."
