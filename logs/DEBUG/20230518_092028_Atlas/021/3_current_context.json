The command returned: Agent <name> created with key 0. First response: Please provide me with the latest news headlines. I also received a command to list files in a specified directory. Previously, I received a command to browse a website with a specified URL and question, but the command returned an error message of \"Invalid URL format\". The command list_files returned an empty list. Additionally, you sent a command to analyze the code with the full code string as an argument. The command analyze_code returned an error message asking for the actual code string. You then sent a command to execute_shell with the argument to check the Python version and it returned \"Python 3.10.11\". Recently, you sent a command to execute_shell with the argument to list all running processes, which returned a list of processes and their details. You also sent a command to execute_shell with the argument to display the disk usage in a human-readable format, which returned the disk usage information. Command execute_shell returned the disk usage information of the system. In addition, I received a command from you to execute_shell with the argument to display the memory usage in a human-readable format, which returned the memory usage information. You also sent a command to browse a website with a specified URL and question. The command returned a list of URLs related to the question. Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The top 20 Python libraries for data science are TensorFlow, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Keras, SciKit-Learn, PyTorch, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, LightGBM, ELI5, Theano, NuPIC, Ramp, Pipenv, Bob, Caffe2, Chainer, and PyBrain. These libraries are extensively used for high-level computations, scientific and technical calculations, data analysis and cleaning, data visualization, deep learning, machine learning, and building and evaluating predictive models.

Additionally, you sent a command to execute_shell with the argument to display the Python version, which returned \"Python 3.10.11\". Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT: Python 3.10.11\\n STDERR: ''. You also sent a command to execute_shell with the argument to list all running processes."
