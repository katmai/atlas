Previously, I received a command to browse a website with a specified URL and question, but the command returned an error message of \"Invalid URL format\". The command list_files returned an empty list. Additionally, you sent a command to analyze the code with the full code string as an argument. The command analyze_code returned an error message asking for the actual code string.
