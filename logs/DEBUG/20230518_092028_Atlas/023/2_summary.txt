"As the system, I received a command to execute_shell with the argument to list all running processes, which returned a list of processes and their details. The latest development shows that the command execute_shell returned the list of running processes and their details, including the process ID, CPU and memory usage, and command name. Additionally, I received a new command from you to execute_shell with the argument to list the disk usage using the command \"df -h\"."
