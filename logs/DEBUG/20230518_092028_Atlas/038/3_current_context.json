You can also define new columns and use aggregate functions to find specific information about the data. The underlying concepts of a DataFrame can be a bit tricky to understand, but one can start with creating and understanding Series objects, which are similar to lists and dictionaries. A DataFrame is a sequence of Series objects that share the same index and can be created by providing a dictionary in the constructor. You can use tools such as indexing operator, .loc and .iloc data access methods, querying based on column values, grouping and aggregating functions, and manipulating columns by adding, dropping, and renaming them. You can also clean the data by removing missing or invalid values, specifying data types, and combining multiple datasets using .concat() or .merge(). Visualizing the data can be done using the .plot() method, which can create line plots, bar plots, and pie plots. \n \n Links: ['\\n\\n (https://realpython.com/)', 'Start\\xa0Here (https://realpython.com/start-here/)', '\\n Learn Python\\n           (https://realpython.com/pandas-python-explore-dataset/)', ' Python Tutorials →In-depth articles and video courses (https://realpython.com/search?kind=article&kind=course&order=newest)', ' Learning Paths →Guided study plans for accelerated learning (https://realpython.com/learning-paths/)']"
