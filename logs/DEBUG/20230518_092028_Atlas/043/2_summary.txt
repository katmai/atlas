"As the system, I received a command to write tests for a function called add_numbers. The command returned an example test case for the function, which tests it with different input values and ensures that the output is correct. I then received a command to execute a Python file called my_script.py, which was successful and returned the message \"Hello, world!\".\n\nAs the user, I used the command \"google\" to search for information on using pandas in Python and received a list of relevant websites. I then used the command \"browse_website\" to gather information on exploring datasets in pandas and learned about functions such as .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts(). I also learned about creating and understanding Series objects and DataFrames, manipulating columns, cleaning data, and visualizing data using the .plot() method.\n\nI then used the command \"write_tests\" to generate an example test case for the add_numbers function and used the command \"execute_python_file\" to run my_script.py. Finally, I used the command \"generate_image\" to create a scatter plot of the relationship between X and Y variables in the data, which was saved to disk. I also used the command \"google\" to search for a matplotlib tutorial in Python."
