"As the user, I used the command \"google\" to search for a matplotlib tutorial in Python and received a list of relevant websites. I then used the command \"get_text_summary\" to summarize an article about Biden's foreign trip, but it returned an error message. I also attempted to use the commands \"list_files\" and \"read_file\", but they returned too much output and an error message, respectively. Finally, I used the command \"clone_repository\" to clone the scikit-learn repository to a specified path."
