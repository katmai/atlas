I also received a command to generate an image using Matplotlib, which was successful, but encountered an error when trying to tweet about it. I analyzed a code that was subtracting instead of adding numbers and received a command to execute a Python file called \"my_script.py\", but it did not exist. In the latest development, I attempted to list files in the scikit-learn directory but received an error due to too much output. I then attempted to read a file in the same directory.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Failure: command read_file returned too much output.
