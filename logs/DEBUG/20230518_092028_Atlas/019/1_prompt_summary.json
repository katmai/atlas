Previously, I received a command to browse a website with a specified URL and question, but the command returned an error message of \"Invalid URL format\". The command list_files returned an empty list. Additionally, you sent a command to analyze the code with the full code string as an argument. The command analyze_code returned an error message asking for the actual code string. You then sent a command to execute_shell with the argument to check the Python version and it returned \"Python 3.10.11\". Recently, you sent a command to execute_shell with the argument to list all running processes, which returned a list of processes and their details. You also sent a command to execute_shell with the argument to display the disk usage in a human-readable format, which returned the disk usage information.
