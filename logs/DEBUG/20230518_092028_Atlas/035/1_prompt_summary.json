The command returned a message saying the repository was successfully cloned to the specified path. In the past, I received a command to generate an image using Matplotlib, which returned a message saying the image was saved to disk. However, when I tried to send a tweet about the visualization using Matplotlib, the command returned an error message saying \\'Forbidden\\' object has no attribute \\'reason\\'. I also analyzed a code that was subtracting instead of adding numbers, which returned a message suggesting to rename the function to better reflect its behavior. Lastly, I received a command to execute a Python file called \"my_script.py\", but it returned an error message saying the file does not exist.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"list_files\", \"args\": {\"directory\": \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/scikit-learn\"}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Failure: command list_files returned too much output.
