"As the user, I received a command to browse a website for information on exploring datasets in pandas. My computer returned a detailed answer from the website, including functions such as .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts() to display data types, basic statistics, and how often specific values occur in a column. It also provided information on creating and understanding Series objects, manipulating columns, cleaning data, and visualizing the data using the .plot() method. The answer included links to additional resources on the website. In addition, I received a command to write tests for a function called add_numbers, with a focus on testing it with different input values."
