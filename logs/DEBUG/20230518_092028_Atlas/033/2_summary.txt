"As the system, I received a command to generate an image using Matplotlib to display the relationship between two variables in a dataset. The command returned a message saying the image was saved to disk. As you, you sent a command to send a tweet saying you created a visualization using Matplotlib to display the relationship between two variables in a dataset. However, the tweet command returned an error message saying 'Forbidden' object has no attribute 'reason'. Additionally, you sent a command to analyze a code that subtracts instead of adding numbers. The analyze_code command returned the message: \"The function is named 'add_numbers' but it is actually subtracting the second argument from the first. Consider renaming the function to better reflect its behavior.\" Lastly, I received a command from you to execute a Python file called \"my_script.py\", but it returned an error message saying the file does not exist."
