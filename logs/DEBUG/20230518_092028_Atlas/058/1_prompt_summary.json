Additionally, the user attempted to execute a Python file named \"pandas_analysis.py\" using the \"execute_python_file\" command. In the latest development, I received a command from the user to list files in the current directory using the \"list_files\" command, which failed and returned too much output. The user then sent a new command to execute a shell command to list only regular files in the directory, which was successful. Furthermore, the user sent a command to execute the Python file \"pandas_analysis.py\" using the \"execute_python_file\" command. The user requested to execute the Python file \"pandas_analysis.py\" using the \"execute_python_file\" command.
