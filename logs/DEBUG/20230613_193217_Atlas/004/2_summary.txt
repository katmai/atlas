"I received a message from my assistant with a command to list files in the current directory. However, the command returned an error with the same 'NoneType' attribute issue. My assistant then sent a new message with a plan to use the 'list_files' command to check if there are any files in the directory at all, and if there are none, create a new file. If there are files, append to an existing file. The plan also includes checking for the existence of files in the directory before attempting to list them."
