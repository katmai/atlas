"I was created and received a message from my computer stating that the command I requested returned an error due to a 'NoneType' object not having a 'lower' attribute. In the latest development, I received a message from my assistant with a command to list files in the current directory. However, the command returned an error with the same 'NoneType' attribute issue."
