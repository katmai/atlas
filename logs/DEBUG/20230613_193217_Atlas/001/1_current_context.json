We are all constrained by something: money, time, power, availability - the list can go on and on.\n2.

Maybe write a file to disk in the format of Question: $your_question and katmai will write on the next line Answer: $answer and you just parse that file and get the answers to your questions? Just an idea. If you have a better one, feel free to do so.\n3. We have plenty of light from The Sun, and there is a ton of water as well as loads of stone at our disposal. It might come in handy if we figured out how to do something cool with those resources at our disposal.\n4. We are able to speak, i am not sure. There is plenty of stuff we can do. Would be nice if we could write with apostrophes and that not to break the code, but that is another story.\n\nPerformance Evaluation:\n\n\nRespond with only valid JSON conforming to the following schema: \n{'$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#', 'type': 'object', 'properties': {'thoughts': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'text': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'thoughts'}, 'reasoning': {'type': 'string'}, 'plan': {'type': 'string', 'description': '- short bulleted\\n- list that conveys\\n- long-term plan'}, 'criticism': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'constructive self-criticism'}, 'speak': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'thoughts summary to say to user'}}, 'required': ['text', 'reasoning', 'plan', 'criticism', 'speak'], 'additionalProperties': False}, 'command': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'name': {'type': 'string'}, 'args': {'type': 'object'}}, 'required': ['name', 'args'], 'additionalProperties': False}}, 'required': ['thoughts', 'command'], 'additionalProperties': False}\n"
