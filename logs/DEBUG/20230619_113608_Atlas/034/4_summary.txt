"I attempted to run \"calculate_distance.py\" multiple times with an invalid API key, receiving the same error message each time. I then received a new command to update the API key and run the script again. I updated the code with a valid API key and ran the script again. The script successfully printed the distance and travel time between Yellowstone National Park and Mount Washburn, as well as extracted necessary information about the trail. However, when attempting to run the script again with the updated code, I received an error message stating that an invalid API key was provided. I then received a command to update the code with a valid API key and run the script again."
