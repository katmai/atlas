Therefore, I need to modify the Python file to use a valid API key. I can do this by adding the corrected API key to the calculate_distance.py script using the append_to_file command. Once I have made the necessary changes to the file, I can use the execute_python_file command to run the updated script and get the necessary information about the hiking trail.",
