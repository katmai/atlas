"I attempted to run \"calculate_distance.py\" again, but received a syntax error due to an unclosed bracket in the code. The AI sent me a message with empty content and role \"you\". When I ran the command \"execute_python_code\" with the API key defined in the code, I received an error message stating that the API key provided was invalid. The error message was repeated multiple times."
