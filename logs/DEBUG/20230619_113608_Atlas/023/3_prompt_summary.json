However, the command returned an error message stating that it was missing a required positional argument. I then tried to obtain a valid API key for the Google Maps API, but encountered errors with the commands \"search\" and \"grep\". I then used the \"execute_shell\" command to curl the website for obtaining an API key and used the obtained key in the code.
