"I attempted to run \"calculate_distance.py\" again, but received a syntax error due to an unclosed bracket in the code. The AI sent me a message with empty content and role \"you\". When I ran the command \"execute_python_code\" with the API key defined in the code, I received an error message stating that the API key provided was invalid. The error message was repeated multiple times. I attempted to run the command \"execute_python_code\" multiple times with the same invalid API key, and each time received the same error message. The code in the command includes defining the API key, using the Google Maps API to get directions and travel time, and using the execute_shell command to extract trail information from a website. In response to the errors, I wrote the code to a file using the \"write_to_file\" command. The file was written successfully."
