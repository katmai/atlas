"I attempted to append the API key code to \"calculate_distance.py\" using the \"append_to_file\" command, which returned a success message. However, when I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command, I received an error message indicating an invalid API key was provided. I tried to install the googlemaps module using the \"execute_shell\" command, which returned a success message. I then executed the \"execute_python_file\" command again, but received the same error message. I tried to obtain a valid API key for the Google Maps API using the \"browse_website\" command, but was unable to find any useful information. I attempted to search for information on obtaining a valid API key using the \"execute_shell\" command, but received an error message. I then tried to visit a website to obtain information on obtaining a valid API key using the \"execute_shell\" command, which returned a redirect message. I used the \"grep\" and \"awk\" commands to extract information about a hiking trail from a website using the \"execute_shell\" command. I then used the \"execute_python_code\" command to execute a script that used the googlemaps module to calculate the distance and travel time between two locations, and also extracted information about a hiking trail using the \"grep\" and \"awk\" commands."
