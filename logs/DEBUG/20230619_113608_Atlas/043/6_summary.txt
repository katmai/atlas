"I attempted to append a valid API key to \"calculate_distance.py\" using the \"append_to_file\" command, which returned a success message. However, when I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command, I received an error message indicating an invalid API key was provided. I then obtained a valid API key for the Google Maps API and rewrote the code in \"calculate_distance.py\" to include the new key. I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command again, but received the same error message. I unsuccessfully attempted to use the \"execute_shell\" command to open \"calculate_distance.py\" and make changes."
