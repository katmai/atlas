"I attempted to append the API key code to \"calculate_distance.py\" using the \"append_to_file\" command, which returned a success message. However, when I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command, I received an error message indicating an invalid API key was provided. I also attempted to execute the \"execute_shell\" command to edit the file, but received an error message saying it was not allowed. Finally, I tried to write the code to the file using the \"write_to_file\" command, which returned a success message."
