"I encountered an error while trying to obtain a valid Google Maps API key due to JavaScript sources failing to load. I searched for how to obtain a valid API key using the command \"search\" but received an error message that the command was not found. I used the command \"curl https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started\" and received a response with a link to a webpage on how to get started with Google Maps API. I then attempted to execute the command \"curl https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started | grep \\\\\"Obtain an API key\\\\\"\". The command returned a response with no output."
