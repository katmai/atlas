"I attempted to update the code in \"calculate_distance.py\" with a valid API key, but received an error message saying \"Invalid API key provided.\" I then attempted to run the command \"calculate_distance.py\" but received an error message saying it was an unknown command. I then wrote the updated code with the valid API key to the file \"calculate_distance.py\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. I appended the code to the file using the \"append_to_file\" command with the filename \"calculate_distance.py\" and the text \"# Define the API key\\nAPI_KEY = 'YOUR_VALID_API_KEY'\". The command returned a success message."
