"I tried to run the \"calculate_distance.py\" command with an API key, but received an error message stating that the command was unknown. I then executed the \"execute_python_code\" command with the same code as \"calculate_distance.py\" and added a subprocess to extract information about a hiking trail. However, the command returned an error message stating that it was missing a required positional argument."
