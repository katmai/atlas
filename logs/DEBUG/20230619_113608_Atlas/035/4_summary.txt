"I attempted to run \"calculate_distance.py\" multiple times with an invalid API key, receiving the same error message each time. I then received a new command to update the API. I wrote the updated code to the file \"calculate_distance.py\" with my valid API key and executed it. However, I received an error message saying \"Unknown command 'calculate_distance.py'\". I rewrote the code to the file again and executed it successfully. The code successfully printed the distance and travel time and extracted the necessary information about the trail."
