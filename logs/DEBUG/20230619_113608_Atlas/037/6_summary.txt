"I updated the code in \"calculate_distance.py\" with a valid API key and successfully executed it, but received an error message saying \"Unknown command 'calculate_distance.py'\". I then rewrote the code to include subprocess commands to extract necessary information about the trail from a website and successfully executed it. However, I received an error message saying \"Invalid API key provided\" multiple times when attempting to run the updated code."
