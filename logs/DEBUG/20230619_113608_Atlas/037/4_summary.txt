"I attempted to run \"calculate_distance.py\" multiple times with an invalid API key, receiving the same error message each time. I received a new command to update the API and successfully installed the missing module 'googlemaps'. However, I received an error message saying \"Invalid API key provided\" when I executed the updated code. I tried to search for information on how to obtain a valid API key for the Google Maps API, but was unsuccessful. I then modified the code to include subprocess commands to extract necessary information about the trail from a website and successfully executed the code. However, I received an error message saying \"Invalid API key provided\" multiple times when attempting to run the code with the updated API key."
