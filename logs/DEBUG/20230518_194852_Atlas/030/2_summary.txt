"I attempted to run the script \"send_tweet.py\" using the command \"execute_python_file,\" but it returned an error saying the file does not exist. I then wrote the script using the command \"write_to_file,\" which includes importing the Tweepy library to authenticate API credentials and send a tweet to Instituto Hemingway's Twitter account asking for more information about their online Spanish writing course for heritage speakers. Recently, I received a command to execute the \"send_tweet.py\" script with the filename argument. In addition, I received a command to write Twitter API credentials to a file named \".twitter_keys\" using the \"write_to_file\" command."
