It is recommended for Spanish speakers who have been educated in a different language or Spanish schools but still struggle with grammatical errors and unclear syntax. The course lasts for 30 hours and is divided into five teaching units, with each unit ending with a self-evaluation exercise and a corrected exercise to show improvement. The course is conducted via a virtual classroom where students can communicate with their teacher and other students through a course forum and email. The course is completed at the student's own pace, and a certificate is awarded upon completion. \n \n Links: ['More information (https://www.institutohemingway.com/hiring-conditions-in-spanish-courses-and-programs.php#coo)', 'Home (https://www.institutohemingway.com/index.php)', 'Spanish courses (https://www.institutohemingway.com/spanish-courses-in-bilbao.php)', 'Spanish courses in Bilbao (https://www.institutohemingway.com/spanish-courses-in-bilbao.php)', 'General spanish course in Bilbao (https://www.institutohemingway.com/intensive-spanish-courses-in-bilbao.php)']"
