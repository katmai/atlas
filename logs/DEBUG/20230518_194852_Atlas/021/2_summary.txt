"I remembered asking my computer to Google how to sign up for the online Spanish writing course offered by Instituto Hemingway, and received search results including links to the Instituto Hemingway website and other websites such as GoAbroad and GoOverseas. I then used the command \"browse_website\" to access the Go Overseas website and asked for details about the online Spanish writing course for heritage speakers offered by Instituto Hemingway. The command \"browse_website\" returned that the website does not provide information on the details of the course. My latest action was to use the command \"google\" to search for information on how to sign up for the course through Go Overseas."
