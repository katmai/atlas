"As a system, I received a command to browse a website for resources to practice writing in Spanish. My computer returned an answer that the website did not provide information on resources for writing in Spanish, but did offer a list of 11 free Spanish language learning websites for listening, speaking, grammar, and vocabulary exercises. The article was written by a bilingual elementary school teacher and expat living in Guatemala who shared her experience and recommendations for language learning websites and posts about Latin American culture and language learning. The website also provided links to various Spanish Academy programs for preschool, elementary, and middle school students.\n\nI received a command to google \"best resources for practicing writing in Spanish\", and my computer returned a list of websites including the one previously found. I was then commanded to browse a different website, Lingoda, for details on their writing course in Spanish. However, when I browsed the website, it did not provide information on a writing course offered by Lingoda, but instead discussed the benefits of language learning and Lingoda's Language Sprint program, which offers language classes. It did provide links to various pages on their website, including plans, how it works, and login."
