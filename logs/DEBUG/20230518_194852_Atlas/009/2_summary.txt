"As a system, I received a command to Google the best language learning resources for learning Spanish. My computer returned a list of top language learning resources, including websites like The Intrepid Guide, Business Insider, and All Language Resources. Recently, I received a command to browse the website https://www.fluentin3months.com/resources/spanish-learning-resources/ to find the best resources for learning Spanish. The website provided a list of resources, including SpanishPod101, Spanish Uncovered, Why Spanish is Easy, Conversation Countdown, Language Hacking Spanish, Fluent in 3 Months Bootcamp, Unlimited Spanish, Español en 3000, Forvo, LanguaTalk, Preply, Glossika, MOSALingua, and Wordreference. LingQ and Clozemaster Pro are suggested for intermediate and advanced learners. \n\nI was then instructed to write the list of resources to a file named \"spanish_resource_list.txt\", which my computer successfully executed. Finally, I was instructed to execute a shell command to print \"Hola, ¿cómo estás?\" which I completed successfully."
