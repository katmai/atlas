"As a system, I recall receiving a command to Google the best language learning resources for learning Spanish. My computer returned a list of top language learning resources, including websites like The Intrepid Guide, Business Insider, and All Language Resources. Other resources included Quora, Lingualift, and FluentU. Recently, I received a command to browse the website https://www.fluentin3months.com/resources/spanish-learning-resources/ to find the best resources for learning Spanish. The website provided a list of resources, including SpanishPod101, Spanish Uncovered, Why Spanish is Easy, Conversation Countdown, Language Hacking Spanish, Fluent in 3 Months Bootcamp, Unlimited Spanish, Espa√±ol en 3000, Forvo, LanguaTalk, Preply, Glossika, MOSALingua, and Wordreference. LingQ and Clozemaster Pro are suggested for intermediate and advanced learners."
