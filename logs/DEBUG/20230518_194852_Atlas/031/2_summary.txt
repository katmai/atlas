"I successfully wrote Twitter API credentials to a file named \".twitter_keys\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. I also received a command to execute the \"send_tweet.py\" script with the filename argument. My previous attempt to run the script using the command \"execute_python_file\" resulted in an error saying the file does not exist, so I wrote the script using the command \"write_to_file,\" which includes importing the Tweepy library to authenticate API credentials and send a tweet to Instituto Hemingway's Twitter account asking for more information about their online Spanish writing course for heritage speakers."
