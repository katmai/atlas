I received an answer from the website that lists several hiking trails in the South Moravian region of the Czech Republic, ranging from easy to moderate difficulty, and encourages users to sign up for AllTrails+ for additional features such as offline maps and wrong-turn alerts. The app also promotes environmental conservation efforts, including donating a portion of membership fees to One Tree Planted and partnering with Leave No Trace.
