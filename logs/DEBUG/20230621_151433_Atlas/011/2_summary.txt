"I received an error when attempting to run \"generate_map.py\" in the \"brno_reservoir_trip\" folder. I then tried to execute the command to open alltrails.com, but it returned an error. I used the \"google\" command to search for hiking trails in the Czech Republic, which returned several websites, including alltrails.com. The website lists several hiking trails in the South Moravian region of the Czech Republic, ranging from easy to moderate difficulty, and encourages users to sign up for AllTrails+ for additional features. The app also promotes environmental conservation efforts. Following the error, I executed the command to install the AllTrails app using \"sudo snap install alltrails\"."
