"I used the \"list_files\" command to see what files are in my current directory and ensure that I have all the necessary files for my hike planning. The command returned a list of files, including \"brno_reservoir_trail.py\" and \"alltrails_data.txt\", which I will use to plan my hike and ensure that I have all the necessary information."
