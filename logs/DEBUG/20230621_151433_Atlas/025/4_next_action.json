I will also use the 'read_file' command to read the 'alltrails_data.txt' file and ensure that I have all the necessary information for my hike.",
        "reasoning": "The 'brno_reservoir_trail.py' file contains the code necessary to generate a map of the trail, while the 'alltrails_data.txt' file contains important information about the trail, such as the length, elevation gain, and difficulty. By using these two files, I can plan my hike more effectively and ensure that I have all the necessary information.",

I should also double-check that I have all the necessary equipment and supplies for my hike.",
