"I used the \"list_files\" command to check my directory for necessary files. I found \"brno_reservoir_trail.py\" and \"alltrails_data.txt\". I then tried to execute \"brno_reservoir_trail.py\" using the \"execute_python_file\" command, but it returned an error due to an attribute error in the code. I used the \"read_file\" command to read the \"alltrails_data.txt\" file and obtained information about the trail. I then used the \"execute_shell\" command to run the \"pip install\" command, but it failed because it could not find the \"requirements.txt\" file. I used the \"execute_shell\" command again to run the \"pip install\" command with the necessary dependencies to run the \"brno_reservoir_trail.py\" file successfully."
