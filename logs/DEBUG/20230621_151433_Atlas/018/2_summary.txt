"I attempted to scrape hiking trail information from the AllTrails website using Python code, but received an error message stating that the 'find_all' attribute could not be found. To fix this, I received a message to install the alltrails package using the command \"pip install alltrails\", but it returned an error message stating that there is no matching distribution found for alltrails."
