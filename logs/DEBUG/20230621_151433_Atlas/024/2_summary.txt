"I used the \"google\" command to search for directions to the Brno Reservoir trail and found the AllTrails website, which has detailed information about the trail. However, the \"browse_website\" command did not return any useful information about the trail, so I used the \"web_search\" command to find articles or blog posts that provide detailed information about the trail's difficulty level, distance, estimated time, and any potential risks. The search returned several results, which I analyzed to identify the best hiking trails. I have decided to explore the Brno Reservoir trail, which is a moderately challenging route that takes an average of 2 h 14 min to complete. It is a popular area for hiking and running, and the AllTrails website provides information about the trail's difficulty level, distance, estimated time, and elevation gain. I will use this information to plan my hike and ensure that I am prepared for any potential risks."
