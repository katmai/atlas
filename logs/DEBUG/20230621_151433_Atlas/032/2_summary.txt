"I received an error when trying to run the \"pip install -r requirements.txt\" command using the \"execute_shell\" command due to the absence of the \"requirements.txt\" file. However, I was able to successfully install the packages \"geopy\", \"pandas\", and \"requests\" using the \"pip install\" command. I also ran the \"list_files\" command and received a list of files in the current directory."
