"I received an error when attempting to run \"generate_map.py\" in the \"brno_reservoir_trip\" folder. I then asked my computer to browse alltrails.com for the best hiking trails in the Czech Republic. The website returned an advertisement for the AllTrails app, which provides information on hiking trails in various countries, including the Czech Republic. The app lists several hiking trails in the South Moravian region of the Czech Republic, ranging from easy to moderate difficulty, and encourages users to sign up for AllTrails+ for additional features. The app also promotes environmental conservation efforts. Following the error, I executed the command to install the AllTrails app using \"sudo snap install alltrails\"."
