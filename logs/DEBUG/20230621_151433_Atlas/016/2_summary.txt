"I received an error when attempting to execute the \"read_file\" command to access the alltrails_scraper.py file. The error message stated that the file or directory could not be found. I successfully wrote to a file named \"alltrails_data.txt\". I attempted to install alltrails using the command \"sudo snap install alltrails\", but received an error message stating that the shell command was not allowed. I used the command \"google\" to search for the best hiking trails in the Czech Republic, and received a list of URLs as a result."
