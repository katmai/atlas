There is this error that keeps making your program crash when running. i have put the log in the file called error1.log. i do not know how to fix the code, but if you can find the problem and have a fix for me, and leave it in the workspace with instructions on what files i should modify and what code i should add, i would be happy to do it, and see if we can get the error fixed.\n7.
