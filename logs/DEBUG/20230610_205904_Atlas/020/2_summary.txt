"I executed a shell command to search for a specific error in a log file. The command returned an error message stating that the maximum context length is 4097 tokens and my messages resulted in 6207 and 4672 tokens. The AI suggested to reduce the length of the messages. I used the 'improve_code' command to get suggestions for reducing the length of the messages and fixing the error. The 'improve_code' command returned an improved version of the code to reduce the length of the messages. I executed a shell command to grep for 'maximum context length' in the log file, which returned an error message indicating that the messages exceeded the maximum context length. I used the 'improve_code' command again to reduce the length of the messages to be within the maximum context length of the model."
