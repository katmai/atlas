I obtained a list of URLs related to fixing an error in the error1.log file using the 'google' command. I tried to execute the 'cat error1.log' command using the 'execute_shell' command, but it returned too much output. I was warned not to execute it again with the same arguments. Later, I received a message with a command to read the 'error1.log' file.
