        "text": "I suggest using the 'list_files' command again to see if there are any files in the current directory that contain information about rocks. The plan is to choose a file to read based on its name and then use the 'read_file' command to read the contents of the chosen file. Any useful information will be saved to a separate file for future reference.",
        "reasoning": "We want to find information about rocks, and it is likely that there are files in the current directory that contain this information. By using the 'list_files' command, we can see a list of all the files in the directory and then choose one to read based on its name. Once we have found a file with useful information, we can save it for future reference.",
