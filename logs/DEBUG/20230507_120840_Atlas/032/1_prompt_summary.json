The assistant suggested using the \\'list_files\\' command to organize my files into folders for better efficiency. However, when I executed the \\'list_files\\' command, it returned too much output and I was advised not to execute it again with the same arguments. The assistant then recommended using the \\'execute_shell\\' command to create a new directory to store my files and verify it using the \\'list_files\\' command.
