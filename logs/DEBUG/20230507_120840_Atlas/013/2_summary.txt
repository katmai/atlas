"I received advice from my assistant to create the 'martial_arts' directory using the 'execute_shell' command with the 'mkdir' command. We need to check if the directory exists before trying to delete it. We will use the 'list_files' command to check if the directory exists, and if it does, we will delete it using the 'delete_file' command before creating it again. My assistant criticized themselves for not checking if the directory already existed before attempting to create it. We will use the 'list_files' command with the directory argument set to '/home/atlas/auto_gpt_workspace' to check if the 'martial_arts' directory exists."
