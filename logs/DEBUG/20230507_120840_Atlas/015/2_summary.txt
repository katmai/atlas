"I tried to create the 'martial_arts' directory using the 'execute_shell' command with the 'mkdir' command, but it returned an error saying the directory already exists. My assistant suggested we check if the directory exists using the 'list_files' command before proceeding with any plans involving it. They provided a plan to use the 'list_files' command and create the directory with 'execute_shell' if it doesn't exist. They also criticized themselves for not checking if the directory existed before trying to create it. They asked if they should use the 'list_files' command to check if the directory exists."
