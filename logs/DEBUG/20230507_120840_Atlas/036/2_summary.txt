"I used the 'generate_image' command to save an image of a river to the 'river_files' directory. The assistant suggested using the 'browse_website' command to learn more about martial arts and how its principles can be applied to our journey. The command's name is 'browse_website', and its argument is to browse the URL 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts' and answer the question \"What are the different types of martial arts and their philosophies?\". The website provided an overview of the different types of martial arts, including traditional vs. contemporary styles, armed vs. unarmed techniques, and application or intent. Unarmed martial arts can be further grouped into those focusing on strikes, grappling, or hybrid techniques. Armed martial arts encompass a wide range of melee weapons and may also include modern sports such as fencing and archery. The text does not provide a detailed discussion of the philosophies behind each type of martial art."
