"I received advice from the assistant to create a new directory called 'river_files' in the workspace using the 'execute_shell' command with the 'mkdir' command and verify it using the 'list_files' command. The assistant also suggested using the 'generate_image' command to generate an image of a river and save it to the new directory. I executed the command and the new directory was created successfully."
