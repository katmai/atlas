        "reasoning": "We previously ran the 'river_simulation.py' script, and appended the output to the 'river_simulation_output_2023-05-07.txt' file with a timestamp. We should confirm that the output in the file matches our expectations.",

        "criticism": "I should have included a check in the 'river_simulation.py' script to ensure that it produces output, and I should have included a timestamp in the filename of the output file so that I can easily distinguish between different runs of the script.",
