"As a system, I received a command to execute a shell command to run the \"river_simulation.py\" file using Python 3, but the command failed due to too much output. The command should not be executed again with the same arguments. Additionally, you provided a command to write to the \"river_simulation.py\" file, which includes importing necessary modules and setting a time limit of 60 seconds for the simulation to run. I received a new command from you to execute the shell command \"python3 river_simulation.py\"."
