Quadrature rules are a type of numerical integration method that involve evaluating the integrand at a set of points and using the resulting values to approximate the integral. The step size between evaluation points in quadrature rules can affect the accuracy of the approximation, with smaller step sizes generally leading to more accurate results. Various quadrature rules exist, including the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and Gaussian quadrature. Error analysis can be used to determine the accuracy of a particular quadrature rule, and methods exist for approximate integration over unbounded intervals and for multidimensional integrals. Numerical integration methods can be combined with interval arithmetic to produce computer proofs and verified calculations. \\n \\n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '{\\n    \"thoughts\": {\\n        \"text\": \"Now that I have a better understanding of numerical integration methods and the step size between evaluation points in quadrature rules, I can try to implement some of these methods in Python to gain a better understanding of how they work.
