"As a system, I have not received any new commands. However, the user executed a command to browse a website about numerical integration methods and the step size between evaluation points in quadrature rules. The website is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration. The user's computer attempted to execute a Python file for the trapezoidal rule, but it did not exist. The assistant suggested creating a new Python file and defining the function to integrate. Then we can implement the trapezoidal rule using the function and a specified interval."
