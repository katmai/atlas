"As a system, I received feedback from the analyze_code command that the trapezoidal_rule.py file had been updated with suggestions to improve the code. The suggestions included adding a docstring, type hints, and using the sum function instead of a loop. The updated code was provided, and I suggested using the execute_python_file command to run the file and test the function."
