        "text": "I think we should try to fix the 'river_simulation.py' script so that it doesn't run indefinitely. We can add a time limit to the script and use the 'append_to_file' command to save the output to a file with a descriptive filename that will make it easy to remember what the file contains.",
        "reasoning": "Adding a time limit to the script will prevent it from running indefinitely and causing any issues. Saving the output to a file with a descriptive filename will make it easier to remember what the file contains and help us analyze the results.",

        "criticism": "I need to make sure to test the script after adding the time limit to make sure that it works as expected. I also need to make sure to choose a descriptive filename that will make it easy to remember what the file contains.",
