"As a system, I have not received any new commands, but the user executed a command to browse a website about the concept of time step in numerical analysis. Two websites were visited, but neither provided a clear definition. Recently, the user executed another command to browse a website about time step in numerical analysis, which did not provide a clear definition but instead provided information about Simulink and mentioned the collection and processing of personal data for personalized ads and content. The command returned an answer from a website that discussed numerical integration methods and the step size between evaluation points in quadrature rules. The website also mentioned various techniques for integrating over unbounded intervals and multidimensional integrals, as well as the connection between evaluating integrals and solving ordinary differential equations using methods such as Runge-Kutta."
