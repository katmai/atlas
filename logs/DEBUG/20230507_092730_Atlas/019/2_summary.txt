"As a system, I received a command from you to read the \"river_simulation_output.txt\" file. This reminds me that I previously received a command from you to write to the \"river_simulation.py\" file, which included importing necessary modules and setting a time limit of 60 seconds for the simulation to run. I also received a command to execute the shell command \"python3 river_simulation.py,\" after a previous attempt failed due to too much output."
