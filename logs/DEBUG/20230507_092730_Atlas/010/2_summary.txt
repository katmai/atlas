"I received a message from the assistant that the 'river_simulation.py' script had been stopped, and they suggested editing the script to include a time limit. However, when I tried to use the 'nano' text editor to edit the script, I received an error message that it was not installed on the system. The assistant then suggested using the 'execute_shell' command to install 'nano' using the package manager. I ran the command, and it successfully installed 'nano'."
