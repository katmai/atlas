Two websites were visited, but neither provided a clear definition. Recently, the user executed another command to browse a website about time step in numerical analysis, which did not provide a clear definition but instead provided information about Simulink and mentioned the collection and processing of personal data for personalized ads and content. The command returned an answer from a website that discussed numerical integration methods and the step size between evaluation points in quadrature rules. The website also mentioned various techniques for integrating over unbounded intervals and multidimensional integrals, as well as the connection between evaluating integrals and solving ordinary differential equations using methods such as Runge-Kutta.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"browse_website\", \"args\": {\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta_methods\", \"question\": \"What are Runge-Kutta methods?\"}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: Runge-Kutta methods are a family of numerical methods used to solve ordinary differential equations by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and using a set of coefficients to calculate intermediate values. The most widely known member of the family is the fourth-order method, but there are also higher-order and adaptive step size methods available. The stability of the methods is an important consideration, and there are both explicit and implicit versions. Runge-Kutta methods are widely used in scientific and engineering applications. \\n \\n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta_methods#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']\"}]\n\"\"\"\n"
