"As a system, I have not received any new commands. However, the user executed a command to browse a website about Runge-Kutta methods, which are a family of numerical methods used to solve ordinary differential equations by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and using a set of coefficients to calculate intermediate values. The website also provided information about the stability of the methods, and that they are widely used in scientific and engineering applications."
