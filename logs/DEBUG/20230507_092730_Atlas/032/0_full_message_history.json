The most widely known member of the family is the fourth-order method, but there are also higher-order and adaptive step size methods available. The stability of the methods is an important consideration, and there are both explicit and implicit versions. Runge-Kutta methods are widely used in scientific and engineering applications. \n \n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta_methods#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']"

Quadrature rules are a type of numerical integration method that involve evaluating the integrand at a set of points and using the resulting values to approximate the integral. The step size between evaluation points in quadrature rules can affect the accuracy of the approximation, with smaller step sizes generally leading to more accurate results. Various quadrature rules exist, including the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and Gaussian quadrature. Error analysis can be used to determine the accuracy of a particular quadrature rule, and methods exist for approximate integration over unbounded intervals and for multidimensional integrals. Numerical integration methods can be combined with interval arithmetic to produce computer proofs and verified calculations. \n \n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']"
