"I received a command to install the 'river' package using the 'execute_shell' command. The command was successful and returned a list of installed packages. However, when attempting to use the 'execute_python_code' command to draw a river using the 'turtle' module, it returned an error indicating that the 'turtle' module was not installed. Therefore, I used the 'execute_shell' command to install the 'turtle' module using the 'apt-get' package manager. The command was successful and returned a message indicating that the module was installed."
