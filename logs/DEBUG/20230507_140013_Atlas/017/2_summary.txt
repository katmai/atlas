"I used the command \"generate_image\" and it returned an image saved to disk. Additionally, I wrote a martial arts poem to a file named \"martial_arts_poem.txt\" using the command \"write_to_file\". The poem describes martial arts as a journey of the mind and a way of life, and emphasizes the importance of focus, energy, and dedication."
