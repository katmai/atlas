"I previously executed the command \"rm -rf martial_arts_code && git clone https://github.com/AtlasLearnsToCode/martial_arts_code.git martial_arts_code && ls martial_arts_code\" using the execute_shell_popen command, which started a subprocess with PID 262. Recently, the command execute_shell_popen returned subprocesses with PIDs 273, 284, and 295. There have been no new developments."
