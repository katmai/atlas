"I previously created a new directory called \"martial_arts_code\" and cloned the repository \"https://github.com/AtlasLearnsToCode/martial_arts_code.git\" into it. However, when I tried to execute the clone_repository command again, it returned an error stating that the repository was not found. In response, I executed the command \"ls martial_arts_code\" to check the contents of the directory."
