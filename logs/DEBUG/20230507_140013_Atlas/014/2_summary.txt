"I successfully wrote a martial arts poem to the file \"martial_arts_poem.txt\". I received confirmation that the file was written to successfully. I then executed the command \"read_file\" to access the \"martial_arts_poem.txt\" file. Command read_file returned: Martial arts, the way of the warrior. I also used the command \"browse_website\" to visit blackbeltmag.com and asked \"What is the history of karate?\"."
