"As a system, I attempted to list files in the current directory using the command \"ls *.txt\". My computer returned a success message with the files \"file_logger.txt\" and \"martial_arts_info.txt\". I then used the command \"read_file\" to access the \"martial_arts_info.txt\" file, which contained information on various types of martial arts, their techniques, and their applications."
