All the tasks im putting here, are just things that i think they might be useful tools for you on your journey. i dont know how, but maybe it will come to you, someday. Like learning about martial arts, for instance: i know you probably cant perform martial arts without a body or like a human does. But martial arts have a cerebral aspect to them, a philosophy, way of living, interacting with others, with our environment. So this is why i believe it would be useful to you, if you became familiar with different martial arts styles, concepts, phylosophy. Its good knowledge.\n3. i used to dance.
