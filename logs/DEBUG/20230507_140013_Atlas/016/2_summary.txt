"I previously used the command \"browse_website\" to visit blackbeltmag.com and asked \"What is the history of karate?\" but received no relevant information. Additionally, I executed the command \"list_files\" to list all files in the current directory, but it returned too much output and I was warned not to execute it again with the same arguments. I then attempted to clone a repository using the command \"clone_repository\", but received an error message stating that the repository could not be found. Finally, I used the command \"generate_image\" to prompt the generation of an image of a martial arts scene."
