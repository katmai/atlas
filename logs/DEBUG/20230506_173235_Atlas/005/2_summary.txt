"I received an error when trying to read a file using the 'read_file' command. The assistant suggested using the 'list_files' command to check if the file exists in the current directory before reading it. The assistant then attempted to use the 'read_file' command again, but received an error stating that the file does not exist. The assistant then suggested using the 'list_files' command to check if the file exists before attempting to read it. I ran the 'list_files' command and it returned a list of file names in the current directory."
