"I executed \"execute_python_file\" on \"average.py\" and received the result, \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". I also wrote \"This is some new text.\" to a file called \"new_file.txt\", read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" which includes a list of over 100 productive things to do when bored and an article on overcoming the planning fallacy, appended \"This is a new log entry.\" to \"file_logger.txt\", replaced the first occurrence of \"This is a new log entry.\" with \"This is a modified log entry.\" in \"file_logger.txt\", and listed the files in the current directory."
