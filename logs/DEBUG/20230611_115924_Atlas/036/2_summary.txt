"I executed \"execute_python_file\" on \"average.py\" and received the result, \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". I read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and appended \"This is a new log entry.\" to \"file_logger.txt\". I replaced the first occurrence of \"This is a new log entry.\" with \"This is a modified log entry.\" in \"file_logger.txt\". I listed the files in the current directory again and received a list of files."
