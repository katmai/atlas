"I attempted to read \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and append \"Appended text.\" to \"file_logger.txt\". I then replaced \"Appended text.\" with \"Replaced text.\" in \"file_logger.txt\" and attempted to delete it again, but received an error message. I requested a list of files in the current directory and received a response with a list of file names. I executed \"average.py\" and received \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". I wrote \"This is some new text.\" to \"new_file.txt\"."
