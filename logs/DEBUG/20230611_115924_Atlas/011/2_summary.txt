"I received a command to write a Python script to automate a repetitive task and save it to a file named \"automate_task.py\". The script involves searching for files with a specific extension in a directory and performing a repetitive task on each file. The command was successful and the file was written to successfully. However, when attempting to execute the \"replace_in_file\" command on a file named \"example.txt\", an error occurred due to the file not being found in the specified directory."
