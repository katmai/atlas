"I attempted to delete \"file_logger.txt\" but received an error message that it had already been deleted. I listed the files in the current directory and executed \"average.py\" successfully. I wrote \"This is some new text.\" to \"new_file.txt\" but received an error message that the file had already been updated. I read \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and appended \"This is a new log entry.\" to \"file_logger.txt\" multiple times. I then replaced \"This is a new log entry.\" with \"This is a modified log entry.\" in \"file_logger.txt\" successfully. I listed the files in the current directory again and executed \"average.py\" successfully."
