I executed a Python file called \"average.py\" and received the message \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\".

I wrote to \"new_file.txt\" but received an error message saying the file has already been updated. I tried to replace \"This is a new log entry.\" in \"file_logger.txt\" with \"This is a modified log entry.\" but received a message saying no matches were found.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"delete_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"new_file.txt\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command delete_file returned: File deleted successfully.', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
