"I attempted to read the \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" file and append \"Appended text.\" to \"file_logger.txt\". I then replaced \"Appended text.\" with \"Replaced text.\" in \"file_logger.txt\" and attempted to delete it again, receiving the same error message. I requested a list of files in the current directory and received a response with a list of file names."
