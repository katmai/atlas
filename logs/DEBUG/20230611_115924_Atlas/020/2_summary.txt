"I used the \"list_files\" command to get a list of files and directories in my current directory. The command returned a list of files including \"atlas.yaml\", \"average.py\", \"test_average.py\", and various other files. I then used the \"read_file\" command to read the file \"productive_things_to_do.txt\". The file contained a list of over 100 productive things to do when bored, an article on overcoming the planning fallacy, a personal account of following Benjamin Franklin's daily schedule, and promotion of a free time tracking software called Clockify."
