"I executed \"execute_python_file\" on \"average.py\" and received the result, \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". I read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and received information about productive things to do when bored and a free time tracking software called Clockify. I appended \"This is a new log entry.\" to \"file_logger.txt\" and replaced the first occurrence of it with \"This is a modified log entry.\" in \"file_logger.txt\". I listed the files in the current directory and received a list of files. I executed \"execute_python_file\" on \"average.py\" again and received the same result. I read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" again and received the same information."
