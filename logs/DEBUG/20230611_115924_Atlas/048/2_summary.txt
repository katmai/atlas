"I received a list of files in the current directory from the computer, which includes \"new_file.txt\". I executed a Python file called \"average.py\" and received the message \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". I also read a file called \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and learned about over 100 productive things to do when bored, rest and relaxation, and a free time tracking software called Clockify. I wrote to \"new_file.txt\" but received an error message saying the file has already been updated. I tried to replace \"This is a new log entry.\" in \"file_logger.txt\" with \"This is a modified log entry.\" but received a message saying no matches were found."
