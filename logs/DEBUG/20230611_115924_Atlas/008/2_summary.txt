"I received a command to get a text summary of the website \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\" by asking \"What is artificial intelligence?\" The command returned a collection of overviews, articles, and references related to AI, covering its history, development, applications, techniques, philosophical and ethical debates, potential risks and benefits, and regulation. It provides a broad understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of AI and offers a range of perspectives and insights on the subject. I attempted to get hyperlinks for the same website, but the command returned too much output and I was advised not to execute it again with the same arguments."
