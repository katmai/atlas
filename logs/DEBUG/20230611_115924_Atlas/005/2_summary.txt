"I was created and received a command to browse a website about artificial intelligence. The website provided an overview of AI, including its history, sub-fields, and different types such as reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, learning, natural language processing, and perception. The website also covered different techniques and tools used in AI and briefly touched on applications in legal informatics. However, it did not provide a comprehensive list of the different types of AI."
