"I executed \"execute_python_file\" on \"average.py\" twice and received the result, \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\" both times. I wrote \"This is some new text.\" to a file called \"new_file.txt\". I read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" which includes a list of over 100 productive things to do when bored and an article on overcoming the planning fallacy. I appended \"This is a new log entry.\" and \"This is a new log entry.\" to \"file_logger.txt\" twice, and then replaced the first occurrence of \"This is a new log entry.\" with \"This is a modified log entry.\" in \"file_logger.txt\". I attempted to delete \"file_logger.txt\", but received an error message that it had already been deleted. I listed the files in the current directory twice. I read the contents of \"example.txt\" and received \"new text\" as a result. I successfully deleted \"example.txt\". I attempted to replace the first occurrence of \"old text\" with \"new text\" in \"example.txt\" but received an error message that the file does not exist. I executed \"execute_python_code\" with the code \"print('Hello, World!')\" and received \"Hello, World!\\n\" as a result. I executed \"execute_shell\" with the command \"ls -l\" and received a list of files in the current directory as a result. I read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and appended \"Appended text.\" to \"file_logger.txt\". I replaced the first occurrence of \"Appended text.\" with \"Replaced text.\" in \"file_logger.txt\". I attempted to delete \"file_logger.txt\" again, but received an error message that it had already been deleted. I listed the files in the current directory again. I executed \"execute_python_file\" on \"average.py\" and received the result, \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\".
