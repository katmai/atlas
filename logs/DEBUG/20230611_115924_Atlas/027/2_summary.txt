"I received an error message when attempting to replace text in \"example.txt\" and when trying to delete \"file_logger.txt\". I created a new directory using \"mkdir -p /path/to/new/directory\" and received no output. I requested a list of files in \"/path/to/directory\" and received an empty list. I appended \"new text\" to \"example.txt\" and read the file, receiving \"new text\" as a response. I successfully deleted \"example.txt\". I executed Python code \"print('Hello, World!')\" and received \"Hello, World!\" as a response. I executed \"ls -l\" and received a list of file names in the current directory. I read \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and received a description of the website content. I appended \"Appended text.\" to \"file_logger.txt\", replaced it with \"Replaced text.\", and then successfully deleted it. I wrote \"This is some new text.\" to \"new_file.txt\" and received confirmation that the file was written to successfully."
