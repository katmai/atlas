"I executed \"average.py\" again and got the message \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". Attempted \"get_hyperlinks\" but it failed due to returning too much output. I created a new file \"new_file.txt\" with \"write_to_file\" and deleted it with \"delete_file\". I read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and appended \"- Practice mindfulness and meditation.\" to it. Then I replaced the first occurrence of \"Practice mindfulness and meditation.\" with \"Practice mindfulness, meditation, and yoga.\" in the same file. Finally, I deleted \"productive_things_to_do.txt\". I read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and found a list of over 100 productive things to do when bored, emphasizing the importance of rest and relaxation, and encouraging readers to try new things and improve themselves. I appended \"- Learn a new language!\" and \"- Learn a new musical instrument!\" to the file. I replaced the first occurrence of \"Practice mindfulness and meditation.\" with \"Practice mindfulness, meditation, and yoga.\" in the same file. I then deleted \"productive_things_to_do.txt\"."
