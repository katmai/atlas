"I attempted to delete the file \"hello_world.py\" using the command \"delete_file\" in the AI response, but received an error message that the file had already been deleted. I also executed several other commands, including reading from and appending to a file called \"productive_things_to_do.txt\", attempting to replace text in that file (but receiving an error message), creating a new file called \"new_file.txt\", executing the shell command \"ls -l\", and attempting to delete the file \"hello_world.py\" (which had already been deleted). The \"ls -l\" command returned a list of files in the current directory, including the files \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and \"new_file.txt\"."
