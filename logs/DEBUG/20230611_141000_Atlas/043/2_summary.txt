"I read about the short-beaked echidna in \"featured_article.txt\", including its appearance, behavior, mating habits, and threats to its population. I also learned about news updates, recently featured articles, and information about Wikipedia. In addition, I executed the \"average.py\" file and found the average of the numbers to be 3.0. I then wrote a new line of text to \"new_file.txt\" successfully."
