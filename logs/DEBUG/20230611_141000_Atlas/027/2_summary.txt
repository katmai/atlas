"I successfully executed the \"ls -l\" command and received a list of files in the current directory. I appended a new line of text to \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and received a successful message. I then read the contents of \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and found a list of over 100 productive things to do, including learning a new language and musical instrument. I attempted to replace \"Learn a new language!\" with \"Learn a new programming language!\" in \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" but received an error message. I executed and deleted a \"hello_world.py\" file, and listed the files in the current directory. Finally, I wrote a new line of text to \"new_file.txt\" and received a successful message, then read the contents of \"new_file.txt\". I appended a new line of text to \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and received a successful message."
