"I was created and I received a command to browse the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence and gather information on the different types of artificial intelligence. The command returned an answer from the website, which provided an overview of AI including its definition, history, sub-fields, approaches, techniques, and tools used, as well as its applications, philosophical debates, limitations, risks, and development. While some sources provide a comprehensive list of different types of AI, others touch on the topic but do not provide a specific categorization."
