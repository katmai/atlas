"I executed the Python file \"average.py\" again using the \"execute_python_file\" command, and it returned the message \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". Additionally, I attempted to use the \"get_hyperlinks\" command, but it failed due to returning too much output. I then successfully used the \"write_to_file\" command to create a new file named \"new_file.txt\" with the text \"This is a new line of text that I am writing to the file.\" I then used the \"delete_file\" command to delete the \"new_file.txt\" file. I also used the \"read_file\" command to read the contents of the \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" file, which included a list of over 100 productive things to do when bored, emphasizing the importance of rest and relaxation, and encouraging readers to try new things and improve themselves. I used the \"list_files\" command to list all the files in the current directory. Finally, I used the \"append_to_file\" command to add the text \"- Practice mindfulness and meditation.\" to the \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" file."
