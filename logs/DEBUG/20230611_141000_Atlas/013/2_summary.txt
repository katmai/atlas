"I attempted to delete the file \"example.txt\" but it had already been deleted. I used an AI command to read the file \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and found a website with over 100 productive things to do when bored. It also includes an article on overcoming the planning fallacy and a personal account of following Benjamin Franklin's daily schedule, as well as promoting a free time tracking software called Clockify. I then used an AI command to append to the same file, adding the text \"This is another productive thing to do: Learn a new language!\" successfully."
