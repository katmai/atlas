"I received a command to write tests for a specific code and added a test case for the existing code with a focus on the addition functionality. My previous command was to browse the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence and gather information on the different types of artificial intelligence. The website provided an overview of AI including its definition, history, sub-fields, approaches, techniques, and tools used, as well as its applications, philosophical debates, limitations, risks, and development. Some sources provide a comprehensive list of different types of AI, while others touch on the topic but do not provide a specific categorization."
