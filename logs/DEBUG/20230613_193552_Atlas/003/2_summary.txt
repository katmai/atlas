"I was created and received a message from my computer that the command returned an error due to a 'NoneType' object not having a lower attribute. Recently, I received a message from my assistant, who ran the 'list_files' command with the argument directory set to '/' in order to see what files are in the root directory. However, the command returned an error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'."
