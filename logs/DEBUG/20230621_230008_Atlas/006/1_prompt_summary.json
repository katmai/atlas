Combine them, adding relevant key information from the latest development in 1st person past tense and keeping the summary concise.\n\nSummary So Far:\n\"\"\"\nI received a command to search for the most promising ideas for interstellar travel and propulsion systems. The search returned several articles, including Project Daedalus, a concept design for an interstellar probe, and a NASA report on a breakthrough propulsion architecture for interstellar precursor missions. Other articles discuss new technologies that could make interstellar travel a reality, such as nuclear thermal propulsion engines and laser-pushed light sails. There are also promising propulsion schemes in development, including ion thrusters and fusion-driven rockets. Interstellar travel and exploration is technically possible, but it is not easy.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"Breakthrough Starshot project, Daedalus spacecraft, and using black holes for interstellar travel\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://phys.org/news/2019-03-black-holes-conquer-space-halo.html\", \"https://www.livescience.com/55981-futuristic-spacecraft-for-interstellar-space-travel.html\", \"https://interestingengineering.com/science/from-point-a-to-point-b-how-do-we-achieve-interstellar-flight\", \"https://www.universetoday.com/141724/using-black-holes-to-conquer-space-the-halo-drive/\", \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel\", \"https://academic-accelerator.com/encyclopedia/interstellar-travel\", \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01174\", \"https://www.centauri-dreams.org/category/breakthrough-propulsion/\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
