"I received a command to search for interstellar travel ideas, and my latest search returned articles on the Breakthrough Starshot project, Daedalus spacecraft, and using black holes for interstellar travel. These articles and previous ones discuss various propulsion schemes, including nuclear thermal propulsion engines and ion thrusters. Interstellar travel is technically possible but challenging. My latest action was to search for the Breakthrough Starshot project, which returned several articles on the project's aim to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail interstellar probes named Starchip, capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away. The project aims to demonstrate proof of concept for ultra-fast light-driven nanocrafts and lay the foundations for a first launch to Alpha Centauri within the next generation."
