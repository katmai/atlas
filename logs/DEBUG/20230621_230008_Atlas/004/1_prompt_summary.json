The command returned a list of articles discussing the feasibility of such technology, including a report by a NASA scientist analyzing the possibility of warp drive. While the majority of scientific knowledge concludes that faster-than-light travel is impossible, some physicists are investigating the potential through new classes of hyper-fast solitons.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"web_search\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"fastest spacecrafts and propulsion systems for interstellar travel\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command web_search returned: [\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Interstellar travel - Wikipedia\",\\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_travel\",\\n        \"body\": \"Interstellar travel is the hypothetical travel of spacecraft from one star system, solitary star, or planetary system to another.
