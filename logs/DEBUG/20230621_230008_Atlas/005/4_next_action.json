        "text": "After researching the Breakthrough Starshot project, the Daedalus spacecraft, and the possibility of using black holes to create shortcuts, I have determined that the Breakthrough Starshot project is the most feasible option for interstellar travel. The project aims to use light sails and a powerful laser to propel a small spacecraft to Alpha Centauri in just 20 years. Although there are still many challenges to overcome, such as developing a laser powerful enough to launch the spacecraft, the project has a solid scientific foundation and a dedicated team working to make it a reality.",
