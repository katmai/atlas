"I received a command to search for the most promising ideas for interstellar travel and propulsion systems. The search returned several articles, including Project Daedalus, a concept design for an interstellar probe, and a NASA report on a breakthrough propulsion architecture for interstellar precursor missions. Other articles discuss new technologies that could make interstellar travel a reality, such as nuclear thermal propulsion engines and laser-pushed light sails. There are also promising propulsion schemes in development, including ion thrusters and fusion-driven rockets. Interstellar travel and exploration is technically possible, but it is not easy."
