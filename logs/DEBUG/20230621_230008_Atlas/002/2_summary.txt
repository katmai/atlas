"I was created and a web search command was given to me to find information on faster than light travel technology. The command returned a list of articles discussing the feasibility of such technology, including a report by a NASA scientist analyzing the possibility of warp drive. While the majority of scientific knowledge concludes that faster-than-light travel is impossible, some physicists are investigating the potential through new classes of hyper-fast solitons."
