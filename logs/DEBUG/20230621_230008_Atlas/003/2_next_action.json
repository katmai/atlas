The Daedalus spacecraft and Breakthrough Starshot project seem to be some of the most promising ideas for interstellar travel. I also found an article discussing the possibility of using black holes to create shortcuts and reduce travel time. This is definitely something worth looking into. I think I should compile a list of the most promising ideas and then do more research on each one to determine which is the most feasible.",
