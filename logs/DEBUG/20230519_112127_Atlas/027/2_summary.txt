"As the system, I received a command from the user to list the files in the directory \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/\". However, when I attempted to execute the command, my computer returned a failure message due to too much output. I was instructed not to execute the command again with the same arguments. In response, I executed the command \"append_to_file\" with the arguments \"filename\": \"notes.txt\" and \"text\": \"My goal is to learn different languages.\""
