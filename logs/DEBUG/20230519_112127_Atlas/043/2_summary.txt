"As the system, I have not received any new developments since executing the successful installation of the Duolingo package using pip. However, I attempted to execute a Python file at '/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/language_learning.py' but received an error stating that the file does not exist. As a result, I wrote a command to create the file and import the Duolingo package, create a Duolingo object, get language progress, and print the progress."
