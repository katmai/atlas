            "text": "Here are some love quotes that I found:\n\n- \"I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.\" - Marilyn Monroe\n\n- \"You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, love like you'll never be hurt, sing like there's nobody listening, and live like it's heaven on earth.\" - William W. Purkey\n\n- \"You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.\" - Dr. Seuss\n\n- \"A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.\" - Elbert Hubbard\n\n- \"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare\n\n- \"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. And that's what you've given me. That's what I'd hoped to give you forever.\" - Nicholas Sparks\n\n- \"Love is not a relationship. Love relates, but it is not a relationship. A relationship is something finished. A relationship is a noun; the full stop has come, the honeymoon is over. Now there is no joy, no enthusiasm, now all is finished. You can carry it on, just to keep your promises. You can carry it on because it is comfortable, convenient, cozy. You can carry it on because there is nothing else to do. You can carry it on because if you disrupt it, you will have to start all over again. But it is not a love. Love is a verb, not a noun.\" - Osho\n\n- \"Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.\" - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry\n\n- \"I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.\" - Robert Fulghum"
