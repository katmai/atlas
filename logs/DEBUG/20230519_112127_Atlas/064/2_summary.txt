"As the system, I received a command from you to upgrade the \"duolingo\" package, but it was already installed. Recently, you executed a shell command which returned a warning about running pip as the 'root' user and notified of a new release of pip. You also sent a command to execute a python file called \"language_learning.py\". Command analyze_code returned suggestions to add error handling and use a try-except block in case the request fails. Command execute_python_file returned an error regarding the 'duolingo' module having no attribute 'Duolingo'. You then sent a command to search for 'duolingo API changes' on Google. Command google returned a list of websites related to Duolingo API changes, and you requested to browse the website https://github.com/KartikTalwar/Duolingo to check for any changes that might be causing the error."
