"As the system, I previously received a command from you to upgrade the \"duolingo\" package, but it was already installed. Recently, you executed a shell command which returned a warning about running pip as the 'root' user and notified of a new release of pip. You also sent a command to execute a python file called \"language_learning.py\". Command analyze_code returned suggestions to add error handling and use a try-except block in case the request fails."
