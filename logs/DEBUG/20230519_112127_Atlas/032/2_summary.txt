"As the user, I used the \"execute_shell\" command to add a repository and update the system before attempting to install the \"translate-shell\" package again. However, the package was not available for Debian 11. I used the \"google\" command to search for alternative ways to translate text from the command line and found the \"trans\" command. I then used the \"execute_shell\" command to install the \"trans\" package, but it was not available in the default Debian repositories. I used the \"execute_shell\" command again to add the necessary repository and update the system, but the \"add-apt-repository\" command was not available on Debian 11. I used the \"execute_shell\" command to install the \"software-properties-common\" package, which includes the command."
