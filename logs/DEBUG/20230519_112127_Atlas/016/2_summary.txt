"As a system, I received a command to read the file \"language_resources.txt\" and your computer returned a list of language learning resources. Additionally, you gave me a command to browse the website \"https://www.atlasobscura.com/\" and find unique destinations and interesting stories associated with them. However, the command to get hyperlinks from the website failed due to too much output. Do not execute this command again with the same arguments. You also gave me a command to Google \"information about love\"."
