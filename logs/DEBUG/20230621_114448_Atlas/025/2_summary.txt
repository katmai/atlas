"I was asked to determine the difficulty level of the Brno Reservoir Loop trail, which I found to be moderate on the AllTrails website. I was then asked to search for factors affecting the difficulty level of the trail, but the command returned an error and no text was summarized. I executed a ping command and a curl command on the AllTrails website and found that it has been moved to HTTPS. I then used Google to find information on the trail's length and difficulty level, but browsing the AllTrails website and Google did not provide any text to summarize."
