"I executed a web search command to find information on the Brno Reservoir Loop trail and received a response with multiple results, including a 5.4-mile out-and-back trail that takes an average of 2 hours and 14 minutes to complete. The trail is considered moderately challenging and has a few places for refreshments along the way. I also found a website with popular trail running trails near Brno."
