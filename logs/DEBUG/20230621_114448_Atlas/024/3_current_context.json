The trail is not a complete loop around the reservoir, but there are sections of waterfront path or roadside sidewalk available for running. The area is hilly and there is approximately 8 km of decent running in the reservoir area. The top end of the reservoir around U Sirky beach is a good area to start, and there is bus access available. Additionally, there are options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, including quiet, low trafficked roads and trails in the Junák hiking area.\n\nLinks: ['About (https://greatruns.com/about/)', 'About Great Runs (https://greatruns.com/about/)', 'Great Runs Team (https://greatruns.com/great-runs-team/)', 'Working With Great Runs (https://greatruns.com/working-with-great-runs/)', 'GR in the Media (https://greatruns.com/as-seen-in/)']"
