I then executed a curl command and found that the website has been moved to HTTPS. I used Google to find information on the Brno Reservoir Loop trail's length and difficulty level, but browsing the AllTrails website and Google did not provide any text to summarize. I also tried to browse the AllTrails website to find factors affecting the difficulty level of the trail, but it did not provide any text to summarize.
