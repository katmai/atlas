"I attempted to browse https://www.alltrails.com/ for notable features of a hiking trail, but received a server error. The error message suggested to retry or contact the help center at help.openai.com. I checked my internet connection by pinging google.com and running a Python code to check if the internet connection is working. The result showed that my internet connection is working. Later, I used the AI to browse the website and found a list of hiking trails in the Brno region of the Czech Republic, with varying levels of difficulty and lengths. The AllTrails+ app offers additional features such as offline maps and wrong-turn alerts. The company is committed to protecting the environment and is a Leave No Trace partner."
