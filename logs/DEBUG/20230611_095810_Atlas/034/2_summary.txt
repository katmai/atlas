"I successfully appended the text \"This is a new line of text.\" to the file \"Atlas/executed_code/my_file.txt\" and replaced it with \"This is a modified line of text.\" at occurrence index 0. I then read and deleted the file. I listed all files in the directory \"Atlas/executed_code\" and executed the file \"Atlas/executed_code/hello_world.py\" again, which returned \"Hello, world!\". Lastly, I wrote \"This is a new line of text.\" to the file \"Atlas/executed_code/my_file.txt\" and replaced it with \"This is a modified line of text.\" at occurrence index 0 successfully."
