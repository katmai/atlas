"I asked my AI assistant to execute \"Atlas/executed_code/average.py\" using the command \"execute_python_file\". My computer returned a list of files in the \"Atlas/executed_code\" directory using the command \"list_files\". The list includes \"average.py\" as well as other Python files and a text file."
