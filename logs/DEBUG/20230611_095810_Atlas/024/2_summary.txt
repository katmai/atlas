"I attempted to replace a line of text in \"Atlas/executed_code/my_new_file.txt\" using the command \"replace_in_file\" with \"This is a new line of text.\" as the old text and \"This is a modified line of text.\" as the new text, but the occurrence index was out of range. I received a response from my computer after using the \"read_file\" command on the same file, which returned the contents \"This is a new line of text.This is another line of text.\""
