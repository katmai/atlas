"I executed the file \"Atlas/executed_code/hello_world.py\" and it returned \"Hello, world!\". I then appended the text \"This is a new line of text.\" to the file \"Atlas/executed_code/my_file.txt\" successfully. I replaced the text \"This is a new line of text.\" with \"This is a modified line of text.\" in the same file at occurrence index 0 and successfully executed the command. I read the file \"Atlas/executed_code/my_file.txt\" and then deleted it successfully. I listed all files in the directory \"Atlas/executed_code\" and executed the file \"Atlas/executed_code/hello_world.py\" again, which returned \"Hello, world!\"."
