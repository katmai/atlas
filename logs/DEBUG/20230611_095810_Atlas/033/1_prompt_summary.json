I then received a command to list all files in the directory \"Atlas/executed_code\" and saw a list of files. I was then given a command to write and append text to a new file \"my_new_file.txt\", which was successful. I was then given a command to replace text in the same file, but it returned an error due to an out of range occurrence index. I then received a command to read the same file and successfully executed it. I was then given a command to delete the file \"my_new_file.txt\" and successfully deleted it. Lastly, I received a command to append and replace text in the file \"my_file.txt\" and successfully executed both commands.
