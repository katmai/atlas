"I used the \"execute_python_file\" command to run \"Atlas/executed_code/hello_world.py\" and received a response with the message \"Hello, world!\". I then used the \"list_files\" command to see all the files in the \"Atlas/executed_code\" directory, including \"my_new_file.txt\". I used the \"write_to_file\" command to add a new line of text to \"my_new_file.txt\", and then used the \"append_to_file\" command to add another line of text. I attempted to use the \"replace_in_file\" command to modify the first line of text in \"my_new_file.txt\", but received an error message stating that the occurrence index was out of range. I used the \"read_file\" command to confirm that the file contained both lines of text, and then used the \"delete_file\" command to successfully delete \"my_new_file.txt\". Finally, I used the \"list_files\" command again to confirm that the file was no longer in the directory."
