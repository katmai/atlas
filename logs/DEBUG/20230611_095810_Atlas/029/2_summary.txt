"I used the \"append_to_file\" command to add a new line of text to \"Atlas/executed_code/my_file.txt\". The command returned a response stating that the text was appended successfully. Later, I attempted to replace the first occurrence of \"This is a new line of text.\" with \"This is a modified line of text.\" using the \"replace_in_file\" command, which returned a successful update message."
