"I executed the command \"execute_python_file\" to run a file named \"hello_world.py\", which returned the message \"Hello, world!\". I used \"append_to_file\" to add a new line of text to \"my_file.txt\" and \"replace_in_file\" to modify the appended text. I then read the contents of the modified file, deleted it, and used \"list_files\" to verify the deletion. I executed the command \"execute_shell\" to list all files in the directory and used \"browse_website\" to gather information about Python programming language from a Wikipedia page. I attempted to read the contents of a file named \"featured_article.txt\" but received an error message stating that the file does not exist."
