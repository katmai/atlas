"I executed the command \"read_file\" on the file \"Atlas/executed_code/average.py\" and received the function \"calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) return total / count\". I then executed the command \"list_files\" on the directory \"Atlas/executed_code\" and received a list of files. I wrote \"This is a new line of text.\" to the file \"Atlas/executed_code/my_new_file.txt\" and successfully appended \"This is another line of text.\" to it. I attempted to replace \"This is a new line of text.\" with \"This is a modified line of text.\" at occurrence index 1, but received an error message that the index was out of range. I executed \"Atlas/executed_code/hello_world.py\" and received \"Hello, world!\". I appended \"This is a new line of text.\" to the file \"Atlas/executed_code/my_file.txt\" and successfully replaced it with \"This is a modified line of text.\" at occurrence index 0. I then read the file and received the message \"This is a modified line of text.\" before deleting it successfully. I executed \"Atlas/executed_code/hello_world.py\" and received \"Hello, world!\"."
