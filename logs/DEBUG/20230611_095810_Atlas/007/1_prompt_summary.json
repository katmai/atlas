I successfully completed the command and received a message that the file was written to successfully. The current featured article is about the short-beaked echidna, a species of echidna found in Australia and eastern New Guinea. It is covered in fur and spines, has a distinctive snout, and uses a specialized tongue to catch insects. The article also discusses its behavior, mating habits, and threats to its population.

However, instead of printing 'Incorrect input' when the input is negative, it would be better to raise an exception. Here's the updated code:\\n\\n```\\ndef fibonacci(n):\\n    if n < 0:\\n        raise ValueError('Input must be non-negative')\\n    elif n == 0:\\n        return 0\\n    elif n == 1 or n == 2:\\n        return 1\\n    else:\\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\\n\\nprint(fibonacci(10))\\n``` \\n\\nThis way, if the input is negative, the function will raise a `ValueError` with a helpful message instead of just printing a message to the console.\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
