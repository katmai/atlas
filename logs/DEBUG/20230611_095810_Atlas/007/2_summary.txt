"I was previously commanded to write the current featured article on Wikipedia to a file named \"featured_article.txt\". The article was about the short-beaked echidna, a species of echidna found in Australia and eastern New Guinea. \n\nIn my latest development, I received a message from an AI response that analyzed a code I provided. The code was updated to raise a `ValueError` with a helpful message instead of just printing a message to the console when the input is negative."
