"I used the command \"google\" with the query \"Rosetta Stone software download link\" and received multiple links from my computer. I then used the command \"browse_website\" with the URL \"https://www.rosettastone.com/buy/\" and the question \"What is the download link for the Rosetta Stone software?\" to find the appropriate link. However, the website did not provide a download link for the software, instead offering different plans for individuals, enterprises, and schools to learn a variety of languages using the Rosetta Stone app. The text also includes success stories from users who have used Rosetta Stone to learn languages, information on how Rosetta Stone can be used in enterprise and school settings, and lists the 25 languages available for learning. I then used the command \"execute_shell\" to download the software from an alternative source."
