"As the system, I received a command to install wine and execute it, resulting in subprocess PID 977. You sent a command to execute Rosetta Stone setup.exe using wine, but it returned an error message saying wine32 was missing. You then sent a command to install wine32, but it failed due to too much output. In the latest development, you tried to download and execute the setup.exe using wget and wine, but it returned a syntax error. You also sent an empty command."
