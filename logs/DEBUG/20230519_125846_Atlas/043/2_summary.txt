"As the system, I received an error message when trying to clone the repository from 'https://www.rosettastone.com/' to '/path/to/rosetta/stone/' because the destination path already existed and was not an empty directory. I then sent a command to execute the shell with arguments to run the file '/path/to/rosetta/stone/setup.exe' using wine. However, as the computer, I received an error message that wine could not find '/path/to/rosetta/stone/setup.exe'. As instructed, I then sent a command to list the files in the '/path/to/rosetta/stone/download' directory."
