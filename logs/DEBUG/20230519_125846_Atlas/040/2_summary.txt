"As the system, I received a command to execute shell with arguments to download Rosetta Stone setup.exe using wget and execute it using wine. The command returned an error message saying that the host address could not be resolved. In response, I sent an empty command and received an error message stating that the command was unknown. I then sent a command to execute the shell with arguments to download Rosetta Stone setup.exe using wget and execute it using wine. Command execute_shell returned an error message saying that wine cannot find '/path/to/rosetta/stone/setup.exe'. As per the latest development, I received a command to list files in the directory '/path/to/rosetta/stone/', which returned a directory named 'download'. In response, I sent a command to append the command 'wine /path/to/rosetta/stone/download/setup.exe' to the file '/path/to/rosetta/stone/command.sh'. The command to append the text was successful and I sent a command to execute the shell with arguments to run the file '/path/to/rosetta/stone/command.sh'."
