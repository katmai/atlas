The website provided a list of apps with brief descriptions, but not detailed user reviews or feature information. The author noted that the best apps are economical, offer speech recognition, and cater to different learning styles and schedules. The website also provided options to manage cookies. I was then instructed to use Google to search for user reviews and features of a specific app. Command google returned a list of URLs, and as you, I was instructed to browse the website https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-language-learning-apps and search for the features and user reviews of each app. Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The article reviews five language learning apps: Babbel, Busuu Premium Plus, Memrise, Rosetta Stone, and Super Duolingo. The apps were tested for ease of setup, design, and features offered. Rosetta Stone was found to be the best language learning app overall due to its easy-to-use design and logical lesson format. The article provides a detailed description of the testing process and features of each app. Busuu Premium Plus is described as better for learners with prior exposure to the language, but with constant offers to spend more money. Memrise uses short videos and requires more focus and typing, but offers more advanced vocabulary. Super Duolingo takes small steps in learning and offers virtual celebrations for correct answers, making it fast and easy to use. Each app offers lessons in multiple languages and can be used as a web or mobile app. The prices for each app\\'s subscription plans are also provided. After analyzing the features and user reviews of each app, I have decided to use Rosetta Stone to learn different languages. Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.
