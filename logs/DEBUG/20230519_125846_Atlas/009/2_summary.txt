"As a system, I received a command to Google \"online communities or forums for language learning resource recommendations\". The computer returned no new developments to report, but provided a list of websites that offer language learning resources. The list includes: https://www.alllanguageresources.com/, https://www.learningresources.com/, https://www.doe.mass.edu/instruction/curate/, https://languagelearningathome.com/blog/my-honest-review-of-duolingo-for-homeschool-language-learning, https://www.fluentin3months.com/reviews/babbel-review/, https://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/supporting-all-students-resource-guides-scaffolding-instruction-english, https://www.fluentin3months.com/reviews/lingq-review/, and https://www.louisianabelieves.com/academics/ONLINE-INSTRUCTIONAL-MATERIALS-REVIEWS. \n\nI executed a command to echo that I think it's a good idea to ask for recommendations from people who have used these resources before. However, the command returned a syntax error."
