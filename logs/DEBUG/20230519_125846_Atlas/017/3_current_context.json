The apps were tested for ease of setup, design, and features offered. Rosetta Stone was found to be the best language learning app overall due to its easy-to-use design and logical lesson format. The article provides a detailed description of the testing process and features of each app. Busuu Premium Plus is described as better for learners with prior exposure to the language, but with constant offers to spend more money. Memrise uses short videos and requires more focus and typing, but offers more advanced vocabulary. Super Duolingo takes small steps in learning and offers virtual celebrations for correct answers, making it fast and easy to use. Each app offers lessons in multiple languages and can be used as a web or mobile app. The prices for each app's subscription plans are also provided. \n \n Links: [' (https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-language-learning-apps#maincontent)', '\\n\\n\\n (https://www.cnn.com)', '\\n\\n\\nUnderscored\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored)', '\\n\\n\\n\\n (https://www.cnn.com/)', '\\n                  Memorial Day\\n                 (https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/ https:/www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/deals/memorial-day)']"
