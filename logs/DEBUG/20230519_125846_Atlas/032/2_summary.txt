"As the system, I received a command to execute \"sudo apt-get install wine\" and used \"execute_shell_popen\" to execute it, resulting in subprocess PID 977. You sent a command to execute \"wine /path/to/rosetta/stone/setup.exe\" using \"execute_shell\", but it returned an error message saying wine32 was missing. You then sent a command to install wine32 using \"execute_shell\", but it failed due to too much output. In the latest development, you sent a command to execute \"wine /path/to/rosetta/stone/setup.exe\" again, but it returned an error message saying it couldn't find the file. You also sent an empty command."
