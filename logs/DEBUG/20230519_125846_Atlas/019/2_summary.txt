"As a system, I received a command to browse a website for information on the best language learning apps. The website provided a list of apps with brief descriptions, but not detailed user reviews or feature information. The author noted that the best apps are economical, offer speech recognition, and cater to different learning styles and schedules. The website also provided options to manage cookies. I was then instructed to use Google to search for user reviews and features of a specific app. Command google returned a list of URLs, and as you, I was instructed to browse the website https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-language-learning-apps and search for the features and user reviews of each app."
