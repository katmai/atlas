"As a system, I received a command from the user to execute a shell command to google online communities or forums for language learning resource recommendations. The command returned a list of communities and forums. The user suggested it would be helpful to join multiple online communities and forums to get a variety of recommendations. The user asked for other suggestions on how to learn different languages, and I suggested language learning apps that offer interactive lessons, quizzes, and games. \n\nAfter that, I received a message from my computer saying that the execute_shell command returned a list of language learning apps that offer interactive lessons, quizzes, and games. The computer asked if I wanted to search for the best language learning apps now."
