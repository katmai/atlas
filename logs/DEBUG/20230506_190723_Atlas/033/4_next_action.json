Rivers can be long or short, wide or narrow, and they often join together on their way downstream to make bigger rivers. They can be a source of food, water, and transportation for humans and animals, and they can also be used for generating electricity. Rivers can be managed or controlled through man-made structures, but pollution and over-exploitation are major threats to their ecological health.')"
