"I used the 'get_hyperlinks' command to retrieve hyperlinks from the New York Times website, but it returned too much output and I was warned not to execute it again with the same arguments. Instead, I used the 'browse_website' command to search for a hyperlink to an article about the US debt ceiling. The website did not have any mention or hyperlink to such an article, but it did provide links to the Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy, and Site Map, among others."
