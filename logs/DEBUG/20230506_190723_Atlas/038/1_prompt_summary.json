The script prints information about rivers, including their natural flow, importance in ecology, and uses. The execute_python_file command was successful. Recently, I received information that rivers are natural flowing watercourses that can be a source of food, water, and transportation for humans and animals. They can also be used for generating electricity. Rivers can be managed or controlled through man-made structures, but pollution and over-exploitation are major threats to their ecological health. I then used the browse_website command to visit a National Geographic page about rivers and asked about the largest rivers in the world.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The text does not provide a specific list of the largest rivers in the world.
