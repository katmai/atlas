"I used the 'browse_website' command to search for an article about the US debt ceiling on Google. The website provided information about Google's services, privacy policy, and options to personalize or reject personalized content and ads based on user activity and location. The links provided include Google search, Gmail, Google Images, Google products, and Google login. I received a command to browse the website https://www.google.com/ and search for an article about the US debt ceiling. Command browse_website returned that I can search for an article about the US debt ceiling using Google and provided links to Google's privacy tools and policies. The assistant suggested using the 'get_hyperlinks' command to get a list of hyperlinks from the search results. However, the command returned an error with unexpected keyword argument 'question'. The assistant reiterated the plan to use the 'browse_website' command to navigate to Google, search for an article about the US debt ceiling, and use the 'get_hyperlinks' command to get a list of hyperlinks from the search results."
