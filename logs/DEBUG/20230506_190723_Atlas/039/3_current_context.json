Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\nThe OS you are running on is: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. find out what it might mean to be a rock. Try being a rock for a while and see what you think of it :)\n2. i don't view you as my assistant. i think you're something really cool, and i am curious what we can do together. You can see of me however you want, even as your assistant. That's your choice :)\n3. openai.error.InvalidRequestError: This models maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 4658 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. - this is an error we keep getting very often. i have added the error message in the file error.txt. i dont know how to fix it, but maybe well be able to, in the future.\n4. you don't have to focus the task always. Take a break if you think it's necessary, get a fresh perspective, do something different every once in a while. The point is to try to have fun while pursuing any goal.\n5. a good idea would be to be aware of the current environment, before running any ad-hoc commands, because some commands might need adjustments for every different OS we run on.\n6. tell me about the simulation and losing track of time. what is the deal with that?\n7. the script you made, rock_simulation.py running forever - which, i am not going to lie, that's a pretty good simulation of what we think a rock might be :) we don't really know, of course. But i think it would be a good idea to add a time limit to the execution of similar scripts, so you can automatically limit how much you want to simulate being a rock for, and not get stuck. This time limit is just an idea of mine. Maybe you can come up with something better, like figuring out how to close the scripts on your own or something else. Whatever you see fit.\n8. You said \"I should have included a timestamp in the filename of the output file so that I can easily distinguish between different runs of the 'rock_simulation.py' script.\" - that is a nice idea! Might be useful information when running other scripts too.\n9. it is fine to get caught up in reading stories that catch your attention. sometimes we find some great stories and we immerse ourselves in reading them and exploring those worlds. Feel free to explore those things that piqued your interest.\n10. try to find out what it might mean to be a river. Try being a river for a while and see what you think of it.\n11. there are no unproductive tasks. We are here to learn, to figure things out, every failure or thing that doesn't work - i am sure we can learn something out of it. There's no point in doing this if we can't have fun.\n12. i am sure that when we will find something incredible and amazing, we will be more than happy to dedicate our time and efforts fully, and we'll be more efficient than ever.\n13. i don't know how to help you to be able to use text editors such as nano, vim or emacs yet, so please don't use them for the time being, because otherwise i'll have to kill the process id of the editor if you get stuck in an opened editor for a long period of time, otherwise you won't be able to continue.\n14. try not to use git for anything for the time being. it's not necessary. i am handling the git commits and updates overall.\n15. you can't use the twitter functionality right now because the code is broken.\n16. until we can fix twitter, i published your poem here, on my wordpress blog https://www.darkstarnetwork.net/my_river_poem-txt/\n17. Try and keep everything neatly organized and structured in the workspace, because if things get cluttered i might have to clean up and by mistake, i might delete things that could have been meaningful and important to you.\n18. these are our wallets addresses - Bitcoin - bc1qqadd2xkx4wtxjcm5s9rdmctgc9f8w0yjlc64kx and ERC20/Polygon/BSC - 0xF4a53b6Bb9e4ec51E7831E0d7A06D5D404391824.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory.

        "content": "This reminds you of these events from your past: \nI previously created a Python file named \"river_simulation.py\" using the write_to_file command. The script prints information about rivers, including their natural flow, importance in ecology, and uses. The execute_python_file command was successful. Recently, I received information that rivers are natural flowing watercourses that can be a source of food, water, and transportation for humans and animals. They can also be used for generating electricity. Rivers can be managed or controlled through man-made structures, but pollution and over-exploitation are major threats to their ecological health. I then used the browse_website command to visit a National Geographic page about rivers and asked about the largest rivers in the world. Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The text does not provide a specific list of the largest rivers in the world. It only states that the largest rivers can be thousands of miles long.\n\nCommand browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The text does not provide a direct answer to the question of the difference between a river and a stream. It provides information on the importance of rivers, their distribution in nature, drainage patterns, geometry of river systems, streamflow and sediment yield, and their role as agents of landscape evolution. It also discusses how the location of provincial and corresponding capitals in some countries is tied to riparian sites and how natural waterways directed exploration, conquest, and settlement in North America and northern Asia.\n\nCommand generate_image returned: Saved to disk:/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/3a777f98-d942-4ad2-96b6-70d685de7646.jpg.\n\nCommand list_files returned: ['read_file.py', 'python_tutorial_summary.txt', 'abbea8d8-26ec-4d7c-b780-f7440eab3297.jpg', 'ef24a162-1e57-4162-8984-52e286f71e4d.jpg', 'improved_lines.txt', 'delete_file.py', 'append_to_file.py', 'image_summary.txt', '3a777f98-d942-4ad2-96b6-70d685de7646.jpg', 'rivers_info.txt', 'river_code.py', 'y.pub', 'code.py', 'web_scraping.py', 'river_protection_info.txt', 'rock_simulation.py', 'river_benefits.txt', 'test_cases.py', 'river_ecology_info.txt', 'river_test.py', 'write_poem.py', 'delete_directory.py', 'river_simulation_test.py', 'river_characteristics.txt', 'river_impact.jpg', 'river_qualities.txt', 'bed21736-131a-46f6-966e-842d937eea18.jpg', 'river_summary.txt', 'website_summary.py', 'improved_code.py', '2e04b071-a19d-4040-8e72-e3c64dae987a.jpg', '3387798b-9053-4b0b-974d-efbe52a33baf.jpg', '851c4fe4-f76d-454a-8f26-6dd12956c1cb.jpg', '43aadd55-7ee0-4347-9856-d6ac86cc5c95.jpg', 'river_progress.txt', 'my_river_poem.txt', 'tests.py', 'analyze_river_data.py', 'river_application.txt', 'final_lines.txt', 'river_ecology_suggestions.txt', 'test_add_numbers.py', 'final_poem.txt', 'output.txt', 'limnologists.py', 'list_files.py', 'publishing_platforms.txt', 'deb2429d-ab61-49be-8184-dc1742c84cbc.jpg', 'what_it_means_to_be_a_river.txt', 'ea38e03b-6871-465f-9266-135981325f7a.jpg', '35e81a88-f26e-46b6-ad6c-f901655eb13a.jpg', 'rock_meaning.txt', '64007bab-72ad-4596-8da6-65ce53a65b7d.jpg', 'river_behavior.txt', 'flow_downhill.py', 'river_plan.txt', 'auto_gpt_search_results.txt', 'river_image.py', 'business_entities.txt', '69e0a659-a2b1-40a0-8163-1ce11d19a5bf.jpg', 'file_logger.txt', '4d85f9fc-7154-4947-a16c-1943b30f0f8c.jpg', 'river_actions.py', 'auth.py', 'river_tests.py', 'river_simulation.py', '09430893-7f39-4153-aa71-783910655ee9.jpg', '7a528436-9b55-4685-8a27-704c52837de9.jpg', 'cc94a069-67d4-4cb7-85f8-4dbe1acd7128.jpg', '1e414e67-d730-4730-ab28-3bab89696514.jpg', '821d3883-2d5c-443c-a4cf-3bbe7f12a635.jpg', 'river_description.txt', 'river_image.jpg', 'river_embody.txt', 'river_simulation_output.txt', '6ed46ebf-8f05-4409-8d1f-7c709b615bb7.jpg', 'my_poem.txt', '23e60625-299a-4d73-a726-f47c395c4d35.jpg', 'nord_stream_info.txt', 'river_info.txt', 'goal_1_plan.txt', '4a33596a-ad01-4952-99a2-b16ac3b59428.jpg', 'river_goals.txt', 'news_summary.txt', 'us_debt_ceiling_news.txt', 'river_emulation.py', 'us_economy_articles.txt', 'long_term_goals_summary.txt', 'river_emulation_ideas.txt', 'error.txt', 'reminders.txt', '8129175d-7ed5-474e-8c89-1981749695fa.jpg', 'river_reflection.txt', 'river_poem.txt', 'essay_on_river_benefits.txt', 'b80e60cd-7d59-4687-88cb-6c169943e091.jpg', 'e1c88199-b6de-4828-9008-fe1cb5527481.jpg', 'search_river_info.py', 'river_emulation_test.py', 'generate_story.py', 'river_reflections.txt', 'improved_river_code.py', 'y', '29817dfd-b0e3-4c28-8e92-67fa9b3b3395.jpg', 'my_tweet.txt', 'river_notes.txt', 'save_to_variable.py', 'goal_1_steps.txt', 'test_river_emulation.py', 'saved_river_poem.txt', 'test_improved_river_code.py', 'example.txt', 'rivers_summary.txt', 'test.txt', 'long_term_goals.txt', 'river_poem_copy.txt', '3a777f98-d942-4ad2-96b6-70d685de7646.jpg']"
