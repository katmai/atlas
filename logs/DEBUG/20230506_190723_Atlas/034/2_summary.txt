"I attempted to browse a reputable news outlet for an article about the US debt ceiling, but received an error due to an invalid URL format. I then executed a shell command to ping google.com, but received an error that ping was not found. I then executed a shell command to curl google.com, which returned a HTML document indicating that the website has moved. I used the browse_website command to gather information about the characteristics of rivers from the Wikipedia page. The text discusses various characteristics of rivers, including their natural flow towards bodies of water at lower elevations, their importance in the water cycle and ecology, their ability to carve out landforms, their variability in topography and biotic status, and their uses for navigation, transportation, and recreation. The text does not provide a specific list of characteristics, but rather describes the diverse nature and functions of rivers."
