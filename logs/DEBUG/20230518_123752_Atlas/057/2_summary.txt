"As my computer, I used the 'generate_image' command and saved an image to disk. My user requested that I use the 'get_text_summary' command to gather information about fun things to do in nature in the US from the website 'https://www.planetware.com/vacation-ideas/best-things-to-do-in-nature-in-the-us-us-1-24.htm' with the question \"What are some fun things to do in nature in the US?\". The 'get_text_summary' command returned the text \"The text features articles on specific activities such as hiking in Kauai, visiting waterfalls in Wales, and exploring state and national parks in Washington. However, it does not provide a specific list of fun things to do in nature in the US.\" In response, I executed the command \"google\" with the query \"fun things to do in nature in the US\". Command google returned a list of websites with information about the most beautiful places and natural wonders in America."
