"As per my latest action, I tried to open the website CrazyGames to play Shell Shockers by executing a command. However, the terminal initialization failed and the website couldn't be opened. It looks like the 'execute_shell' command failed again to open the game in a new window. I decided to try using the 'execute_python_file' command again to open the game in a new window. The command I used was to execute the 'open_game.py' file, which should open the Subway Surfers game in a new window. Please make sure that the file 'open_game.py' exists in the current working directory."
