"As my computer, I received confirmation that the file 'subway_surfers_updates.txt' was written successfully using the 'write_to_file' command. I then executed the 'list_files' command on the current directory and received a list of files. However, I received a failure message stating that the 'list_files' command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. In response, I executed the 'read_file' command with the argument 'filename' set to 'subway_surfers_updates.txt'."
