"As the system, I received a command from my user to browse the website 'https://www.busytourist.com/most-beautiful-places-in-the-us/' with the question \"What are some fun things to do in nature in the US?\". My computer returned a list of activities like visiting national parks, hiking, swimming, exploring, snorkeling, and wildlife spotting. I then wrote the list to a file named \"fun_things_to_do_in_nature_US.txt\". The file was written successfully. I tried to list the files in the directory but received too much output. I then read the file \"fun_things_to_do_in_nature_US.txt\"."
