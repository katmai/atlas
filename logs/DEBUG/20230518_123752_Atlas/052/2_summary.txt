"As my computer, I received confirmation that the file 'subway_surfers_updates.txt' was written successfully using the 'write_to_file' command. I then executed the 'list_files' command on the current directory and received a list of files. However, I received a failure message stating that the 'list_files' command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. In response, I executed the 'read_file' command with the argument 'filename' set to 'subway_surfers_updates.txt'. The 'read_file' command returned information about updates and events in the Subway Surfers game in the year 2022, including the release of new characters, hoverboards, and outfits, as well as re-releases of previous editions. Special events such as the Super Runner City challenge and the 10th Birthday celebration are also mentioned. However, the text notes that some characters have lost HD graphics and every edition will be unplayable. Additionally, I searched for fun things to do in my area using the 'google' command."
