However, I received a failure message stating that the 'list_files' command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments.

The 'read_file' command returned information about updates and events in the Subway Surfers game in the year 2022, including the release of new characters, hoverboards, and outfits, as well as re-releases of previous editions. Special events such as the Super Runner City challenge and the 10th Birthday celebration are also mentioned.
