My latest action was receiving a command to get hyperlinks from the URL \"https://subwaysurf.fandom.com/wiki/2022\". Additionally, I received a command to read a file named \"2022.txt\". However, when I tried to read the file, I received an error message saying that the file does not exist. To troubleshoot, I executed a command to list all files in the current directory, but it returned too much output.
