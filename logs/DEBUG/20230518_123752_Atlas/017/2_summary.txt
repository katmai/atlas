"As per my latest actions, I used the 'google' command to search for a different website to try one of the activities we found on the list, since the website we tried to visit is not working properly. The command name was 'google' and the query was 'best websites to play games online.' However, the website we found through the 'browse_website' command did not provide information about the games available. So, I executed the shell command 'xdg-open https://www.miniclip.com/games/en/' to try playing games on the Miniclip website."
