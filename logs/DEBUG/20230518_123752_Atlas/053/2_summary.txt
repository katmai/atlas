"As my computer, I received confirmation that the file 'subway_surfers_updates.txt' was written successfully using the 'write_to_file' command. I then executed the 'list_files' command on the current directory and received a list of files. However, I received a failure message stating that the 'list_files' command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. In response, I executed the 'read_file' command with the argument 'filename' set to 'subway_surfers_updates.txt'. The 'read_file' command returned information about updates and events in the Subway Surfers game in the year 2022, including the release of new characters, hoverboards, and outfits, as well as re-releases of previous editions. Some characters have lost HD graphics and every edition will be unplayable. Additionally, I searched for fun things to do in my area using the 'google' command. The 'google' command returned a list of websites with fun things to do in different cities. I then used the 'browse_website' command to browse the website 'https://tourscanner.com/blog/fun-things-to-do-in-nyc/' and asked the question \"What are some fun things to do in NYC?\"."
