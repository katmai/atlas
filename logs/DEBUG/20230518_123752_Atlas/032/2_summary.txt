"As per my latest action, I used the 'google' command to search for online games to play. The command returned a list of websites including CrazyGames and Poki. I then used the 'browse_website' command to gather information on CrazyGames and found that it offers over 7000 fun games in every genre, including Shell Shockers, Bullet Force, Uno Online, Drift Hunters, and Moto X3M. I attempted to use the 'execute_shell' command to open Shell Shockers, but it failed. I then decided to use the 'execute_python_file' command to open Subway Surfers in a new window. Finally, I used the 'browse_website' command to gather information on Poki and its most popular games."
