The user then requested to use the 'google' command to search for Subway Surfers new updates or events, which returned relevant information including a link to the Subway Surfers Fandom page for 2022, the World Tour, events, and an interview with the game director. When I tried to execute the 'get_hyperlinks' command, it returned too much output and I was instructed not to execute it again with the same arguments. Later, as your computer, the command browse_website returned information about updates and events in the Subway Surfers game in the year 2022, including the release of new characters, hoverboards, and outfits, as well as re-releases of previous editions. Special events such as the Super Runner City challenge and the 10th Birthday celebration are also mentioned. However, the text notes that some characters have lost HD graphics and every edition will be unplayable. You then wrote the information to a file named 'subway_surfers_updates.txt'."
