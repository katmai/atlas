"As per my latest action, I used the 'get_text_summary' command to retrieve a summary of the Subway Surfers game from its Wikipedia page. The command was successful and returned the summary. My computer returned information that Subway Surfers is an endless runner mobile game developed by Kiloo and SYBO Games. The game has received mixed to positive reviews for its visual style and entertaining gameplay but criticized for its monotonous world and unresponsive controls. It has been downloaded over 2.7 billion times and was the most downloaded mobile game of the decade from 2012 to 2019. The game has also been adapted into an animated series. I then requested my computer to browse the Subway Surfers website for updates or events."
