"As per my latest action, I received an error message when using the 'execute_python_file' command to open Subway Surfers due to the missing 'open_game.py' file. However, I quickly found a solution by using the 'execute_shell' command to open Subway Surfers via the Poki website. It seems that we can use this command to open any game listed on Poki, such as Temple Run 2. Please note that the website link should be provided as an argument in the command."
