"As per my latest action, I used the 'browse_website' command to gather information on Poki and found that it offers popular games such as Subway Surfers and Temple Run 2. Based on this information, I used the 'execute_python_file' command to open Subway Surfers in a new window. The latest development suggests that we can use the same command to open games listed on Poki, such as Subway Surfers or Temple Run 2. The plan is to use the 'execute_python_file' command to open one of the games listed on the website. Please note that the file 'open_game.py' should exist in the current working directory and should contain code to open Subway Surfers in a new window."
