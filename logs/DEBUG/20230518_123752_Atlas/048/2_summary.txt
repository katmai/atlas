"As the system, I received a command to execute the shell command to find all files with 'subway' in the name and 'updates' in the content. The command returned an empty output. I also received a command from the user to use the 'google' command to search for Subway Surfers new updates or events. The command executed successfully and returned relevant information including a link to the Subway Surfers Fandom page for 2022, the World Tour, events, and an interview with the game director. However, when I tried to execute the 'get_hyperlinks' command, it returned too much output and I was instructed not to execute it again with the same arguments. The user then requested to browse the Subway Surfers Fandom page for 2022 to find out about new updates or events happening in the game."
