"As per my latest actions, I received a list of popular online games from the 'google' command and attempted to play games on Poki.com using the 'xdg-open' command. In the latest development, I used the 'browse_website' command to access the website 'https://www.gamesradar.com/best-online-games/' and received a list of 25 of the best online games to play today, including popular titles such as Fortnite, League of Legends, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I also received links to the website and social media pages. Additionally, I used the 'execute_shell' command to open the website for Fortnite on Epic Games. However, in my previous attempt to use the 'xdg-open' command, I received an error message stating that the terminal type is unknown and the command could not find the necessary programs to open the website."
