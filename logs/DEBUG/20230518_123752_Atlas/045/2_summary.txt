"As the system, I used the 'google' command to search for Subway Surfers new updates or events, but no relevant information was found. My latest action was receiving a command to get hyperlinks from the URL \"https://subwaysurf.fandom.com/wiki/2022\". Additionally, I received a command to read a file named \"2022.txt\". However, when I tried to read the file, I received an error message saying that the file does not exist. To troubleshoot, I executed a command to list all files in the current directory, but it returned too much output. So, I executed a shell command to find all files with 'subway' in the name and 'updates' in the content."
