"I received an error message when attempting to execute the Python code \"sudo apt-get install iputils-ping && ping -c 5 google.com\". I then executed the shell command \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y iputils-ping && ping -c 5 google.com\" and searched for running routes at Brno Reservoir on the website greatruns.com. I then executed the Python code \"import os\\nos.system('sudo apt-get install iputils-ping')\\nos.system('ping -c 5 google.com')\" and received confirmation that the package was installed and internet connection is working."
