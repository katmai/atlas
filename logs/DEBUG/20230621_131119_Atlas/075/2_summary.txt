"I used the web_search command to find the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland. The command returned links to websites such as Planet of Hotels, HotelsCombined, U.S. News Travel, TripAdvisor, MySwitzerland, Time Out Switzerland, Hintsy, and Lonely Planet. I then executed the browse_website command to gather more information from Lonely Planet, but it did not provide a specific list of recommendations for these locations."
