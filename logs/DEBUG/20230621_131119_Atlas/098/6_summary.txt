"I attempted to execute a Python file related to the Brno Reservoir trail, but received an error message. I successfully installed the necessary packages for it and attempted to execute the file again, but received the same error. I conducted a web search for \"Brno Reservoir trail\" and found several results. I then used a Python script to scrape information from the AllTrails website about the trail's distance and difficulty, but received an error message. I asked the AI to browse the AllTrails website for information on the Brno Reservoir trail, but it returned an error message. I then received an answer from the AI that there is an article providing information on running routes around the Brno Reservoir, including an 8 km waterfront path and information on bus access and other running routes in the area. I used the AI to perform a Google search for \"Brno Reservoir trail\" and found several websites with information on the trail. I also received an answer from the AI that the Stara Pradelna house is a restaurant and accommodation located near Veveří Castle in Brno, offering Czech cuisine, salads, and homemade desserts, and a two-room apartment in a renovated castle laundry building, but no specific information is given about other amenities offered by the Stara Pradelna house."
