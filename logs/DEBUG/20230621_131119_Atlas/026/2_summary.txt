"I attempted to install iputils-ping and ping Google.com five times, but encountered an error. I then updated and installed iputils-ping, but still received an error. I used the \"google\" command to search for \"Brno Reservoir trail\" and received a list of URLs as a result. I asked the AI to browse the website https://greatruns.com/brno-czechia-brno-reservoir-veveri-castle/ to find the best trails to explore at the Brno Reservoir. The AI returned an answer with information on the Brno Reservoir in Czechia, including an 8 km route in the reservoir area with rolling hills and a good starting point at U Sirky beach, as well as options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle. The AI also provided links to the website. I then attempted to execute the command \"sudo apt-get install iputils-ping && ping -c 5 google.com\" but received an error that the shell command is not allowed."
