The AI suggested browsing the website https://www.alltrails.com, which provided information about the Brno Reservoir trail in Czechia. I installed the packages. I used the web_search command to search for more specific information about the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland, but the Lonely Planet website did not provide specific information.
