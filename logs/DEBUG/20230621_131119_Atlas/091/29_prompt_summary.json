The AI suggested using the execute_shell command to install the \"beautifulsoup4\" and \"requests\" Python packages, which I did successfully. I then used the execute_python_file command to run the \"brno_reservoir_trail.py\" file, but it returned an error. The browse_website command did not provide any information about the Brno Reservoir trail, so I used the google command to search for information and got several links. I then used the browse_website command to visit each website and gather information about the trail, but it did not work. Therefore, I used the web_search command to search for information about the Brno Reservoir trail, which I will analyze and use to plan my next steps.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='your computer', content='Command web_search returned: [\\n    {\\n        \"title\": \"Brno Reservoir Trail: 2 Reviews, Map - AllTrails\",\\n        \"href\": \"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/czech-republic/south-moravian/stezka-brnenska-prehrada\",\\n        \"body\": \"Brno Reservoir Trail moderate (2) Brno, South Moravian, Czech Republic Photos (3) Directions Print/PDF Map Share More Discover this 5.4-mile out-and-back trail near Brno, South Moravian.
