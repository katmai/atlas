"I attempted to run the brno_reservoir_trail.py file, but encountered an error. The AI suggested browsing the website https://www.alltrails.com, which provided information about the Brno Reservoir trail in Czechia. I installed the packages. \n\nI used the web_search command to search for more specific information about the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland. However, the Lonely Planet website did not provide specific information on the best attractions or activities. \n\nI then used the google command to search for information on the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland. The browse_website command was used to navigate to the websites returned by the google command, but it did not provide a specific list of the best attractions, activities, and accommodations for these locations. \n\nTherefore, I used the web_search command again to search for more specific information on the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland."
