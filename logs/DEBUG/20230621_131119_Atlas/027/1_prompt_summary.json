I then updated and installed iputils-ping, but still received an error. I used the \"google\" command to search for \"Brno Reservoir trail\" and received a list of URLs as a result. I asked the AI to browse the website https://greatruns.com/brno-czechia-brno-reservoir-veveri-castle/ to find the best trails to explore at the Brno Reservoir. The AI returned an answer with information on the Brno Reservoir in Czechia, including an 8 km route in the reservoir area with rolling hills and a good starting point at U Sirky beach, as well as options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle. The AI also provided links to the website.
