"I used the web_search command to find travel information for Boston, Porto, and Switzerland. The command returned websites like US News Travel, Time Out, and Lonely Planet. I then used the browse_website command to gather more specific information on the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in those locations. While Lonely Planet featured articles on these destinations, there was no specific information on the best attractions or activities."
