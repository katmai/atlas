"I used the web_search command to find the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland. The command returned links to websites such as Planet of Hotels, HotelsCombined, U.S. News Travel, TripAdvisor, MySwitzerland, Time Out Switzerland, Hintsy, and Lonely Planet. I then executed the browse_website command to gather more information from Lonely Planet, but it did not provide a specific list of recommendations for these locations. I attempted to use the execute_shell command to download a PDF guidebook for each location, but it failed. I then used the google command to search for PDF guidebooks for each location, but it did not return the expected results. Finally, I used the web_search command to search for PDF guidebooks for each location, which returned several relevant results, including free PDF guides from Lonely Planet and Authentik Canada."
