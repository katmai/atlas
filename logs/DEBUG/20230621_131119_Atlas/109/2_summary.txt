"I used the \"execute_shell\" command to install the \"beautifulsoup4\" package, which was already installed. The command returned a warning about running pip as the 'root' user and recommended using a virtual environment instead. I received an error when running the \"execute_python_file\" command, which returned an AttributeError for the \"trail_distance\" variable. I then tried to browse the website for any errors or issues, but received an unknown error: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED."
