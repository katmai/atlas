"I attempted to execute a shell command to open several websites, but it returned an error. I then used the browse_website command to gather information on the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland from Lonely Planet. The website provided practical tips, activity suggestions, and accommodation recommendations for travelers, as well as a section on the best destinations and experiences for 2023. The browse_website command returned links to trending guides, signing in, saved lists, and an eLibrary."
