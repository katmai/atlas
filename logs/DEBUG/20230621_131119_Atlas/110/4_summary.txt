"I installed the \"iputils-ping\" package and confirmed internet connectivity. I used the \"google\" command to find hiking trails around Brno and the \"browse_website\" command to find information on the Stara Pradelna house, a restaurant and accommodation near Veveří Castle. I updated the system using the \"sudo apt-get update\" command and tried to list files in the current directory, but received an error. I deleted and then wrote to a new file, and successfully read from it. I executed a \"hello_world.py\" file and used the \"google\" command to find more hiking trails, but received an error when trying to browse the website. Finally, I used the \"web_search\" command to find the location of the Stara Pradelna house."
