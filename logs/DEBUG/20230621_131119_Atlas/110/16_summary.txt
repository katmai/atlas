"I installed the \"iputils-ping\" package and confirmed internet connectivity. I used the \"google\" command to find hiking trails around Brno and the \"browse_website\" command to find information on the St. I used the \"google\" command to find the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland. I used the \"browse_website\" command to find more information. I used the \"web_search\" command to find information on the Brno Reservoir trail and executed a Python file to retrieve trail distance, but encountered an error. I attempted to execute the Python file again, but encountered the same error. I then installed the \"beautifulsoup4\" package using the \"execute_shell\" command and attempted to execute the Python file again, but encountered the same error. Lastly, I attempted to check the website for any errors or issues using the \"browse_website\" command, but encountered an unknown error."
