"I used the web_search command to find the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland. The command returned a list of websites with travel information, including US News Travel, Time Out, and Lonely Planet. These websites provided a variety of options for things to do and see in each location, such as wandering around Boston Common and the Public Garden, catching a concert at the Leader Bank Pavilion, and visiting the Isabella Stewart Gardener museum."
