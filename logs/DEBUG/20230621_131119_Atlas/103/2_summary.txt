"I received an error message when trying to execute a Python file that scrapes information from the AllTrails website. I attempted to run the Python file again with a shell command to change the directory, but it still returned an error message. The latest attempt returned an error message with a traceback indicating an AttributeError due to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'text'."
