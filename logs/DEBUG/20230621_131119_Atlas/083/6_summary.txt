"I used the list_files command to get a list of files in the current directory. Then, I received a response from the AI with a read_file command that returned a Python script for the brno_reservoir. I tried to execute some shell commands but they were not allowed. I used the web_search command to find information about the Brno Reservoir trail and Stara Pradelna house. I also used the google command to find hiking trails near Brno. I deleted and then wrote to a new file, and executed a Python script that printed \"Hello, World!\". I used the google and web_search commands to find the best hiking trails near Brno and the location of Stara Pradelna house. However, the browse_website command returned an error."
