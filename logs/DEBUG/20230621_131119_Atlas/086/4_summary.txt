"I used the google command to search for hiking trails near Brno and received a list of results. I then used the browse_website command to gather information on the Brno Reservoir trail. I also tested my internet connection using execute_python_code and pinged google.com successfully. Lastly, I attempted to browse the website of the city of Brno for information on the Brno Reservoir trail, but the page could not be found. In the latest development, I used the web_search command to find the location of Stara Pradelna house and the google command to find the best hiking trails near Brno. I then used the browse_website command to gather information on Stara Pradelna, a restaurant and accommodation located near Veveří Castle in Brno. The restaurant offers Czech cuisine, salads, and homemade desserts, and the accommodation is a two-room apartment in a renovated castle laundry building. No specific information is given about other amenities offered by the Stara Pradelna house."
