"I used the google command to search for hiking trails near Brno and received a response from the AI with a list of results. I then used the browse_website command to gather information on the Brno Reservoir trail, which includes sections of waterfront path or roadside sidewalk suitable for running, an 8 km route with rolling hills, and options for running near the Veveří Castle. I also tested my internet connection using execute_python_code and pinged google.com successfully. Lastly, I attempted to browse the website of the city of Brno for information on the Brno Reservoir trail, but the page could not be found."
