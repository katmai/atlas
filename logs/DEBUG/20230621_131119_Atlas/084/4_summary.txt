"I used the list_files command to get a list of files in the current directory. Then, I received a response from the AI with a read_file command that returned a Python script for the brno_reservoir. I tried to execute some shell commands but they were not allowed. I used the web_search command to find information about the Brno Reservoir trail and Stara Pradelna house. I also used the google command to find hiking trails near Brno. I used the execute_shell command to open multiple links for Boston, Porto, and Switzerland, but encountered an error. I used the web_search command to find the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland, and also used the google command to find travel guides in PDF format, but did not find any useful results."
