"I used the list_files command to get a list of files in the current directory. Then, I received a response from the AI with a read_file command that returned a Python script for the brno_reservoir. I tried to execute some shell commands but they were not allowed. I used the web_search command to find information about the Brno Reservoir trail and Stara Pradelna house. I also used the google command to find hiking trails near Brno. I used the execute_python_file command to run the Python script for the Brno Reservoir trail, but encountered an error. I used the web_search command again to search for the Brno Reservoir trail, but the search returned no results."
