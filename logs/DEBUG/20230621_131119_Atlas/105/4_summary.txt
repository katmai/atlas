"I used the \"web_search\" command to search for the location of Stara Pradelna house, which returned a list of URLs related to the search. I used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information about the amenities offered by the house, which is a restaurant and accommodation located near Veveří Castle in Brno. The restaurant offers Czech cuisine, salads, and homemade desserts, and the accommodation is a two-room apartment in a renovated castle laundry building. I also used the \"google\" command to search for the best hiking trails near Brno and received a list of URLs. Finally, I attempted to run the \"sudo apt-get update\" command, but it returned an error message. I also used the \"list_files\", \"delete_file\", \"write_to_file\", \"read_file\", and \"execute_python_code\" commands to perform various file operations."
