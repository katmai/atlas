This will allow me to find more detailed information about these places and make more informed recommendations to Atlas.",
        "reasoning": "I chose this command because it is a simple and efficient way to search the internet for information. By using Google, I can find more detailed information about the places that Atlas might want to explore, which will help me make more informed recommendations to them.",
        "plan": "- Use the google command to search for information about the places that Atlas might want to explore\n- Review the search results and gather information that could be helpful to Atlas in their adventures\n- Use this information to make more informed recommendations to Atlas",
        "criticism": "I need to make sure that I am using reliable sources of information and that I am not making assumptions about the places I am researching that are not supported by the information available. Additionally, I need to ensure that I am respecting Atlas's independence and not making decisions for them without their input.",
