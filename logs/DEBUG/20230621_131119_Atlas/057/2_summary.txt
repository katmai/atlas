"I received an error message when attempting to use the browse_website command to visit AllTrails. As a result, I decided to use the web_search command to search for the best hiking trails near Brno. The web_search command returned several links to hiking trails, including AllTrails and Komoot. Additionally, I executed the execute_shell command and received a list of files in my directory. I then received a message to read a file called \"atlas.yaml\" and got information about Atlas, who is an adventuring soul. I also executed a Python code to search for hiking trails near Brno using the Google Maps API, but got an error message."
