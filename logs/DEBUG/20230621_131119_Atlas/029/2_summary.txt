"I asked the AI to browse the website https://greatruns.com/brno-czechia-brno-reservoir-veveri-castle/ to find the best trails to explore at the Brno Reservoir. The AI returned an answer with information on the Brno Reservoir in Czechia, including an 8 km route in the reservoir area with rolling hills and a good starting point at U Sirky beach, as well as options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle. The AI also provided links to the website. I then executed the Python code \"import os; os.system('sudo apt-get install iputils-ping'); os.system('ping -c 5 google.com')\" and successfully installed iputils-ping and pinged Google.com five times. I received a message from the AI with information on running routes around the Brno Reservoir in Czechia, which includes an 8 km route in the reservoir area with rolling hills and options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle. The article also provides information on bus access and other running routes in the area."
