"I attempted to run the brno_reservoir_trail.py file but encountered an error. I received a message from my computer regarding the error and traceback information. The AI suggested browsing the website https://www.alltrails.com. I then received a message from my computer with links to websites providing information about the Brno Reservoir trail in Czechia, including an 8 km mapped route with rolling hills starting at the top of the reservoir closest to Brno. I attempted to run the file again but encountered the same error. The AI suggested installing the packages beautifulsoup4 and requests, which I did successfully. However, I encountered the same error when running the file again."
