"I attempted to read the file \"/usr/share/doc/README\" using the command \"read_file /usr/share/doc/README\" but received an error message stating that the file does not exist. I then used the command \"browse_website\" with the URL \"https://www.brno.cz/en/\" and the question \"What is the Brno Reservoir trail?\" However, the website returned an error message stating that the requested page for the Brno Reservoir trail cannot be found on the website of the city of Brno, Czech Republic."
