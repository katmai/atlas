"I used the google command to search for the best attractions, activities, and accommodations in Boston, Porto, and Switzerland. The command returned links to websites such as Lonely Planet, Four Seasons, and Time Out. I then executed the browse_website command to gather more information from Lonely Planet, but it did not provide a specific list of recommendations for these locations."
