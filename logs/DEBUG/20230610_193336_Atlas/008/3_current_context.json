The latest development shows an AI message confirming the use of 'list_files' command to retrieve a list of files in the current directory, along with the command and its arguments.

Additionally, I received an AI message with its thoughts, reasoning, plan, and speak confirming the use of the 'list_files' command. Finally, I received an action result from my computer that returned a list of all the file names in the current directory.
