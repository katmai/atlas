Additionally, I received an AI response to search for \"Python programming language\" on Google, which returned a list of relevant websites. I then used the AI response to browse the Wikipedia page on Python programming language and gathered information on its features, popularity, applications, and notable industries. Python is a high-level, general-purpose language that emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms. It is widely used in web development, data science, and artificial intelligence, and is known for its simplicity and ease of use. Python has a large standard library and is dynamically typed. The CPython implementation compiles programs into bytecode and is available for many platforms. Notable industries that use Python are not mentioned."
