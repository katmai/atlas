I ran the 'list_files' command and my computer returned a list of file names in the current directory. The latest development shows an AI message confirming the use of 'list_files' command to retrieve a list of files in the current directory, along with the command and its arguments. I received a result from my computer after running the 'list_files' command, which included a list of all the file names in the current directory. Additionally, I received an AI message with its thoughts, reasoning, plan, and speak confirming the use of the 'list_files' command. I also received an AI response for the 'google' command to search for information on a topic, and my computer returned a list of URLs related to the topic. Another AI response suggested the 'execute_python_code' command with the argument 'code': \"print('Hello, World!')\". After running the command, my computer returned the message \"Hello, World!\" as an action result. The latest development includes an AI response recommending the 'write_to_file' command with the argument 'filename': \"new_file.txt\" and 'text': \"This is some text to write to the new file.\" I ran the command and my computer returned the message \"File written to successfully.\" as an action result."
