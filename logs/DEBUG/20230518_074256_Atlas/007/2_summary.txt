"As the system, I received a response from the browse_website command which states that the website tutorialspoint.com has information about the Lisp programming language, including its history, widely known dialects, and various topics related to Lisp programming such as program structure, data types, functions, and error handling. However, it does not specifically mention the key features of the Lisp programming language. Additionally, you gave a command to Google for LISP programming language key features, which I have yet to receive a response for."
