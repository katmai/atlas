"As the system, I received a response from the browse_website command for geeksforgeeks.org, which did not mention the key features of Lisp but provided information on various courses and tutorials. My latest action was to execute the browse_website command for geeksforgeeks.org with the question \"What are the key features of the Lisp programming language?\" and my computer returned a terminal initialization error. You also gave a command to Google for Lisp key features, but I have yet to receive a response."
