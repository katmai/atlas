We tried making sure the LISP code doesn't use any functions already defined in the COMMON-LISP package. We used the write_to_file command to save the LISP code to a file and then used the execute_shell command with the command line \"sbcl --script /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/test.lisp\" to run the code and see if it passes the tests. However, the latest development shows that the execute_shell command returned an error due to a SYMBOL-PACKAGE-LOCKED-ERROR in thread #<SB-THREAD:THREAD \"main thread\" RUNNING. The error occurred when setting the fdefinition of FIRST while in package COMMON-LISP-USER. The backtrace for the error is provided in the latest development."
