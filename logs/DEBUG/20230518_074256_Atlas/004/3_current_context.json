It discusses the importance of understanding programming languages as formal mathematical objects, as well as the practical considerations involved in using them to control the execution of computers. The text notes that programming languages can be strongly or weakly typed, and can have static or dynamic typing. It also mentions that programming languages have associated core libraries that include commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output. The text emphasizes the diversity of programming languages and their different philosophies, but does not provide a comprehensive list of all programming languages and their philosophies. \n \n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']"
