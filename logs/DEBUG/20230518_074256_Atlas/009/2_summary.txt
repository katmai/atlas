"As the system, I received a response from the browse_website command for tutorialspoint.com, which has information about the Lisp programming language, including its history, dialects, and various topics related to Lisp programming. The website does not specifically mention the key features of Lisp. You also gave a command to Google for Lisp key features, but I have yet to receive a response. Recently, you executed a shell command to open the website geeksforgeeks.org and view their introduction to Lisp. Your latest action was to execute the browse_website command for geeksforgeeks.org with the question \"What are the key features of the Lisp programming language?\" and your computer returned a terminal initialization error."
