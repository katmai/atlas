Your computer has returned an answer from the website which provides an overview of programming languages and their classification, including imperative, functional, object-oriented, and declarative paradigms. The text also discusses the importance of understanding programming languages as formal mathematical objects, as well as the practical considerations involved in using them to control the execution of computers. It mentions that programming languages can be strongly or weakly typed, and can have static or dynamic typing. The text emphasizes the diversity of programming languages and their different philosophies, but does not provide a comprehensive list of all programming languages and their philosophies. Additionally, you have given a command to Google for LISP programming language tutorials. Links to the website include Jump to content, Main page, Contents, Current events, and Random article."
