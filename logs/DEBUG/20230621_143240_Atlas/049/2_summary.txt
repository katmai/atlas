"I received a message from the AI with no content. My computer returned a list of URLs from a Google search, including reports on the establishment of a national park trail, magnet cities, and C-ITS deployment. I then attempted to run a custom search command using the `execute_shell` command, but it did not work. I then used the `browse_website` command to manually gather information on the Brno Reservoir trail and the educational trail with six ecologically focused stations, but the website did not provide the information I needed. Finally, I used the `web_search` command to search for more information on the trails."
