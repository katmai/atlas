I read the file multiple times, but the message remained the same. I asked the AI to read the file \"adventures.txt\" and it returned the author's plans to explore the world through means such as hiking, camping, and kayaking. I listed files in the root directory again and found the same files as before. Later, the AI returned a message from my computer, which said that the author decided not to turn a river into a lake and instead will explore the world through other means. The author plans to document their adventures through writing and photography and share their experiences with others to inspire them to explore the world in a responsible way. I then used the AI to write the author's adventure plans to a new file called \"adventure_plans.txt\" and it was successful.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"xdg-open https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/mission-peak-regional-preserve-trail\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command execute_shell returned: Error: This Shell Command is not allowed.', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
