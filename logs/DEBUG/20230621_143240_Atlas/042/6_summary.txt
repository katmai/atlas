"I used the `web_search` command to find information on the Brno Reservoir Trail and discovered that it is a 5.4-mile out-and-back trail that takes an average of 2 hours and 14 minutes to complete and is considered moderately challenging. I also found a 2.9-mile out-and-back trail that takes an average of 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete. I used the `list_files` command to see the files in the current directory and found a file named `brno_reservoir_trail_info.py`. I then used the `read_file` command to see a list of potential hiking trails and found the Brno Reservoir Trail listed. However, I was unable to install the AllTrails Python package using the `execute_shell` command, even after upgrading pip. I attempted to access the AllTrails website using the `browse_website` command, but was unable to find any text to summarize."
