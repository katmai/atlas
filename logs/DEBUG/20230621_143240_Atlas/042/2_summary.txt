"I used the `list_files` command to see the files in the current directory and found a file named `brno_reservoir_trail_info.py`. I opened the file and found that it contains information about the trail, including its length, difficulty level, and other important details. I then used the `read_file` command to see a list of potential hiking trails and found that the Brno Reservoir Trail is one of them. I used the `google` command to search for more information on the trail and found a website called AllTrails that offers information on various hiking trails, including the Brno Reservoir Trail. I attempted to install the AllTrails Python package using the `execute_shell` command, but was unsuccessful. I then searched the web for information on how to install the package and upgraded pip using the `execute_shell` command. However, I was still unable to install the AllTrails package."
