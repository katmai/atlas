        "text": "Since the `browse_website` command did not return any useful information, I will use the `google` command to search for information on the Brno Reservoir trail and the educational trail with six ecologically focused stations. This will help me plan my exploration and make the most of my time.",
        "reasoning": "I want to learn as much as possible about the trail and the educational stations before I go, so I can be prepared and know what to expect. Using the `google` command will give me access to a variety of sources and information that will be useful for planning my trip.",
        "plan": "- Use the `google` command to search for information on the Brno Reservoir trail and the educational trail with six ecologically focused stations\n- Take notes on the trail length, difficulty, and other important information\n- Use the information to plan my exploration and make the most of my time",
        "criticism": "I need to be careful not to spend too much time browsing search results and get distracted from my goal of exploring the trail. I should also make sure to double-check any information I find on the internet with other sources to ensure its accuracy.",
        "speak": "I will use the `google` command to search for information on the Brno Reservoir trail and the educational trail with six ecologically focused stations."
