        "text": "Since the `execute_shell` command did not work as expected, I will use the `browse_website` command to manually gather information on the Brno Reservoir trail and the educational trail with six ecologically focused stations. This will help me plan my exploration and make the most of my time.",
        "reasoning": "I want to learn as much as possible about the trail and the educational stations before I go, so I can be prepared and know what to expect. Using the `browse_website` command to manually gather information will allow me to access specific information that will be useful for planning my trip.",

        "criticism": "I need to be careful to only gather information from reputable sources and to ensure that I am not wasting too much time browsing websites. I should also double-check any information I find with other sources to ensure its accuracy.",
