"I received a message to update pip with the command \"pip install --upgrade pip\". I updated pip to the latest version and tried installing the \"alltrails\" package again, but it failed with the error message \"No matching distribution found for alltrails\". I used the `web_search` command to search for alternative ways to install the package and found the Python Packaging User Guide, which provides instructions for installing packages using pip and virtual environments. I used the `web_search` command to find more information about the Brno Reservoir trail and found several resources, including AllTrails and Go To Brno websites, which provide information about the trail, its difficulty level, and how to get there."
