"I listed files in the root directory and found \"adventures.txt\" among them. I then read the file multiple times, but the message remained the same. I asked the AI to read the file \"adventures.txt\" and then listed files in the root directory twice more. The second and third times I listed the files, I found the same files as before. The AI read the file \"adventures.txt\" and returned the message of the author's plans to explore the world through means such as hiking, camping, and kayaking. I listed files in the root directory again and found the same files as before."
