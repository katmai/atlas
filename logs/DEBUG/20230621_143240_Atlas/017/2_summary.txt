"I asked the AI to search for hiking trails near me using the \"google\" command. The AI returned a list of websites with hiking trails near different cities. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to visit the AllTrails website and asked for the best hiking trails near me. The website provided information on hiking trails in various locations, including Brno and other regions in the Czech Republic. The AllTrails app offers verified trails, offline maps, community reviews, and promotes environmental conservation through partnerships with organizations like Leave No Trace and One Tree Planted."
