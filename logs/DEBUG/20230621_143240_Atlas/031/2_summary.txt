"I received a message from the AI to install the \"alltrails\" package using the \"pip install alltrails\" command. However, the installation failed with an error message stating that no matching distribution was found. The error message also suggested updating pip to the latest version. I used the `web_search` command to search for information on how to install the `alltrails` Python package, which returned several results. One of the results was the Python Packaging User Guide, which provides instructions for installing packages using pip and virtual environments."
