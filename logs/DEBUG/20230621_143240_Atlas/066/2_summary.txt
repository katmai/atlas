"I attempted to use the `read_file` command to access information on the Deer Glen nature reserve, but it returned an error stating that the file does not exist. I received two messages with empty content from the AI, where the role is 'you' and the type is 'ai_response'. Another message with the same content was received. Additionally, I received a message with role 'you', type 'ai_response' and content '{}'. Another message with the same content was received."
