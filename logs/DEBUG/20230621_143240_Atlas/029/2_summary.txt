"I used the \"read_file\" command to retrieve the list of hiking trails from the file \"potential_hiking_trails.txt\" and received a successful response with the list. I then used the \"google\" command to search for information about the hiking trails and received a response with several website links. I received a message from the AI to browse the AllTrails website, which provides information on various hiking trails around the world, including several in the Czech Republic such as the Brno Reservoir Trail, Moravian Karst, Pálava Hills, Jeseníky Mountains, Krkonoše National Park, and Šumava National Park. The app offers features such as verified trails, offline maps, and wrong-turn alerts, and also promotes environmental initiatives such as Leave No Trace and One Tree Planted."
