"I attempted to use the `execute_shell` command to browse the Go To Brno website, but it returned an error. I then used the `browse_website` command to navigate to the website, but it did not provide the information I needed. I then used the `web_search` command to search for information on the Brno Reservoir trail and the educational trail with six ecologically focused stations. The `web_search` command returned a list of URLs from the Go To Brno website with information on the trails. The Brno Reservoir trail is a 5.4-mile out-and-back trail that takes an average of 2 h 14 min to complete. The educational trail has six ecologically focused stations and is a 3-kilometre walk with a rise of 140 metres. The forest stands of Deer Glen with mighty oaks and 200-year-old beeches has been a nature reserve since 1979."
