"I used the `execute_shell` command to update pip to the latest version with the command \"pip install --upgrade pip\". I then attempted to install the `alltrails` Python package again with the command \"pip install alltrails\", but was unsuccessful. I used the `web_search` command to search for alternative ways to install the package. The search results provided information on how to install Python packages and how to manually install them. I then used the `web_search` command again to find more information about the Brno Reservoir trail and how to get there."
