"I used the `execute_shell` command to update pip to the latest version with the command \"pip install --upgrade pip\". I then attempted to install the `alltrails` Python package again with the command \"pip install alltrails\", but was unsuccessful. I used the `web_search` command to search for alternative ways to install the package. The search results provided information on how to install Python packages and how to manually install them. I then used the `web_search` command again to find more information about the Brno Reservoir trail and how to get there. I used the `google` command to search for more information about the Brno Reservoir trail, but the `browse_website` command did not return any useful information. I used the `web_search` command to find other websites that may have information about the trail. I used the `list_files` command to see what files are in my current directory and used the `read_file` command to read the `brno_reservoir_trail.py` file, which contained Python code that retrieves information about the trail from the AllTrails website. Executing the file returned an error, so I used the `web_search` command to search for more information on the Brno Reservoir Trail and see if I can find any other sources of information."
