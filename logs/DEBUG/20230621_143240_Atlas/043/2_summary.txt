"I used the `read_file` command to read the contents of the `potential_hiking_trails.txt` file and found a list of hiking trails in the Czech Republic. I then used the `google` command to search for information on these trails and found several links to websites with information on them. I attempted to use the `browse_website` command to visit the AllTrails website for more information, but was unable to find any useful information. I then attempted to install the `alltrails` Python package using the `execute_shell` command, but was unsuccessful. I used the `google` command to search for instructions on how to install the package, but was unable to find any useful information. I then used the `web_search` command to search the web for information on how to install the package."
