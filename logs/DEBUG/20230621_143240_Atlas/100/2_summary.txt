"I attempted to access information on the Deer Glen nature reserve using `read_file`, but it returned an error saying the file doesn't exist. I received several empty messages from the AI. The latest message I received had role 'you', type 'ai_response' and content '{}', which provided no new information. Another empty message was received with the same role, type, and content."
