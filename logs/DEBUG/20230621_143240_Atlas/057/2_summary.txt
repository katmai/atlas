"I used the `google` command to search for information on the Deer Glen nature reserve and the educational trail with six ecologically focused stations. The command returned several links to websites, including gotobrno.cz and parks.ny.gov. I attempted to open the gotobrno.cz link using the `execute_shell` command, but it returned an error stating that the shell command is not allowed."
