"I attempted to install the AllTrails app using the \"execute_shell\" command but received an error message. I used the \"google\" command to search for hiking trails near me and received a list of websites. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to visit the AllTrails website and search for hiking trails near me. The website provided information on hiking trails in various locations, including Brno and other regions in the Czech Republic. The app offers a variety of features, including verified trails, offline maps, and community reviews. It also promotes environmental conservation through partnerships with organizations like Leave No Trace and One Tree Planted. However, I was unable to install the AllTrails app using the \"execute_shell\" command. I tried to install the app again using the same command but received the same error message."
