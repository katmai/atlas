"I used the `google` command to search for information on the Deer Glen nature reserve and the educational trail with six ecologically focused stations. I then used the `web_search` command to find details about the Brno Reservoir trail, which is a moderately challenging 2.9-mile out-and-back trail near Brno, South Moravian. The trail takes an average of 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete and has a 390 ft elevation gain."
