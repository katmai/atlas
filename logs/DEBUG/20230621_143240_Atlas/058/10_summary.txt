Then, I used the `web_search` command to find details about the Brno Reservoir trail. The `web_search` command returned information about a trail with six ecologically focused stations that runs along the left bank of the Brno Reservoir. I then used the `browse_website` command to find information about the Deer Glen nature reserve and the educational trail. The trail is 3 kilometers long and has 6 ecologically focused stations. The nature reserve has 167 plant species, 26 bird species, 16 moss species, and 11 wood-decay fungus species.
