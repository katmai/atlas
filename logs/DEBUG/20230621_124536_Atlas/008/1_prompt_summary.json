While there is no loop trail around the entire reservoir, there are sections of waterfront path or roadside sidewalk. The article maps out 8 km of the most suitable running in the reservoir area, with rolling hills and a good starting point at U Sirky beach. Additionally, there are options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, including quiet, low trafficked roads and trails in the Junák hiking area. The article also provides information on bus access and other running routes in the Brno area. However, it does not directly answer the question of what the best route to take on the Brno Reservoir trail is.\\n\\nLinks: ['About (https://greatruns.com/about/)', 'About Great Runs (https://greatruns.com/about/)', 'Great Runs Team (https://greatruns.com/great-runs-team/)', 'Working With Great Runs (https://greatruns.com/working-with-great-runs/)', 'GR in the Media (https://greatruns.com/as-seen-in/)']\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
