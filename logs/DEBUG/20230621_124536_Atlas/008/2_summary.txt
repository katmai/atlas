"I used the \"google\" command to search for the best route to take on the Brno Reservoir trail and received several links to websites. Then, I used the \"browse_website\" command to gather more information from greatruns.com. The website provided information on 8 km of the most suitable running in the reservoir area, with rolling hills and a good starting point at U Sirky beach. It also gave options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, including quiet, low trafficked roads and trails in the Junák hiking area. The website did not directly answer the question of what the best route to take on the Brno Reservoir trail is."
