The website provided a description of a 22.7 km hiking route that takes approximately 6.5 hours to complete. The starting point is the Přístaviště tram stop and the destination is the Rakovecká tram stop, with public transportation available via frequent trams and night buses. The trail includes a mix of asphalt, dirt road, forested/wild trail, path, and road, but the best time of year to hike the trail is not specified. The website also provided links to skip to content, a map, a route finder, a route planner, and a travel guide. My previous actions involved encountering an error while attempting to browse the Brno Reservoir trail website and using the command \"google\" to search for route planning options, which returned several links to websites such as outdooractive.com, alltrails.com, and komoot.com, as well as TripAdvisor and Brno Expat Centre.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"best route to take on the Brno Reservoir trail\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://greatruns.com/brno-czechia-brno-reservoir-veveri-castle/\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno\", \"https://greatruns.com/location/brno-czechia/\", \"https://hikingisgood.com/around-the-brno-reservoir/\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/czech-republic/south-moravian/stezka-brnenska-prehrada\", \"https://www.outdooractive.com/mobile/en/route/hiking-route/czech-republic/brno-reservoir/29020361/\", \"http://experienceeurope.eu/hiking-in-brno-my-top-5/\", \"https://www.tripsavvy.com/top-things-to-do-in-brno-czech-republic-5112855\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
