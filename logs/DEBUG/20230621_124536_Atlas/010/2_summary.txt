"I used the \"browse_website\" command to gather more information from hikingisgood.com. The website provided a classic local hike around the Brno Reservoir in Czechia. The author recommends starting in Žebětín and following the green marked route through the forest to Podkomorské lesy. From there, the hike continues to Veveří Castle and then follows the red marked route along the reservoir's eastern side, offering nice views. The hike takes about four hours and ends at the port, where a tram can be taken back to the city center. Swimming in the reservoir is not recommended due to algae. No specific information is given about the best route to take on the trail."
