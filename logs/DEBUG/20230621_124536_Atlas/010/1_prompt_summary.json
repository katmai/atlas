Then, I used the \"browse_website\" command to gather more information from greatruns.com. The website provided information on 8 km of the most suitable running in the reservoir area, with rolling hills and a good starting point at U Sirky beach. It also gave options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, including quiet, low trafficked roads and trails in the Junák hiking area. The website did not directly answer the question of what the best route to take on the Brno Reservoir trail is.

The author recommends starting in Žebětín and following the green marked route through the forest to Podkomorské lesy. From there, the hike continues to Veveří Castle and then follows the red marked route along the reservoir's eastern side, offering nice views. The hike takes about four hours and ends at the port, where a tram can be taken back to the city center. Swimming in the reservoir is not recommended due to algae. No specific information is given about the best route to take on the trail.\\n\\nLinks: ['\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHiking Is Good\\\\nBorn from the love of hiking, writing, photography and life\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n (https://hikingisgood.com/)', 'MENU (https://hikingisgood.com/around-the-brno-reservoir/)', 'Blog (https://hikingisgood.com/category/blog/)', 'Reports\\\\n► (https://hikingisgood.com/around-the-brno-reservoir/)', 'Reports (https://hikingisgood.com/category/hike-reports/)']\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
