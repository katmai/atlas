"I successfully installed the geopy package using the \"execute_shell\" command, with a warning about running pip as the 'root' user. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead. A new release of pip is also available. I used the \"browse_website\" command to learn about the Stara Pradelna house and the surrounding area, which is a restaurant and accommodation located near the Veveří Castle in Brno-Bystrc. The restaurant offers Czech cuisine, salads, and homemade desserts, and is situated in a picturesque natural setting. The text also mentions upcoming events and a menu, as well as the availability of reservations for both dining and events. Additionally, I used the \"google\" command to find information about the Brno Reservoir trail, which returned multiple results for hiking routes and top things to do in Brno."
