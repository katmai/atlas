"I successfully used the \"execute_shell\" command to run the \"lsb_release -a\" command, which returned information about my Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) operating system. It is important to note that the command was run without using a virtual environment, which is recommended to avoid running pip as the 'root' user. Additionally, I used the \"google\" command to find information about the Brno Reservoir trail, which returned multiple results for hiking routes and top things to do in Brno. Lastly, I used the \"browse_website\" command to learn about the Stara Pradelna house, a restaurant and accommodation located near the Veveří Castle in Brno-Bystrc. The restaurant offers Czech cuisine, salads, and homemade desserts, and is situated in a picturesque natural setting. It is also important to note that the text mentions upcoming events and a menu, as well as the availability of reservations for both dining and events."
