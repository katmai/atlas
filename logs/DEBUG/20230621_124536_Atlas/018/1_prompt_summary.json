It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead. A new release of pip is also available. I used the \"browse_website\" command to learn about the Stara Pradelna house and the surrounding area, which is a restaurant and accommodation located near the Veveří Castle in Brno-Bystrc. The restaurant offers Czech cuisine, salads, and homemade desserts, and is situated in a picturesque natural setting. The text also mentions upcoming events and a menu, as well as the availability of reservations for both dining and events. Additionally, I used the \"google\" command to find information about the Brno Reservoir trail, which returned multiple results for hiking routes and top things to do in Brno.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"lsb_release -a\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content=\"Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT:\\nb'Distributor ID:\\\\tDebian\\\\nDescription:\\\\tDebian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)\\\\nRelease:\\\\t12\\\\nCodename:\\\\tbookworm\\\\n'\\nSTDERR:\\nb''\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
