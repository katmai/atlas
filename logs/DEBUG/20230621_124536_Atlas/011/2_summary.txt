"I used the \"google\" command to find the best hiking route for the Brno Reservoir trail. The search results provided a blog post with a detailed description of the trail, including a map and recommended route. The post suggests starting at the Veveří Castle and following the blue marked route along the reservoir's western side. The hike takes about five hours and offers stunning views of the reservoir. The post also advises bringing plenty of water and snacks as there are no facilities along the way."
