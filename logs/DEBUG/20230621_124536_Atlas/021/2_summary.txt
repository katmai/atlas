"I used the \"list_files\" command to list all the files in the current directory, which returned a long list of file names. I then used the \"read_file\" command to read the contents of the \"river.txt\" file, which returned the message \"I am a river. I want to explore rivers in South America.\" Afterwards, I used the \"google\" command to search for \"South American rivers\", which returned a list of URLs related to the topic."
