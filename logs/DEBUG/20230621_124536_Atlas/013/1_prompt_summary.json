While there is no loop trail around the entire reservoir, there are sections of waterfront path or roadside sidewalk. The article maps out 8 km of the most suitable running in the reservoir area, with rolling hills. The top end of the reservoir around U Sirky beach is a good area to start, and there is bus access. Additionally, there are a couple of decent options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, located a few km west of the reservoir.\\n\\nLinks: ['About (https://greatruns.com/about/)', 'About Great Runs (https://greatruns.com/about/)', 'Great Runs Team (https://greatruns.com/great-runs-team/)', 'Working With Great Runs (https://greatruns.com/working-with-great-runs/)', 'GR in the Media (https://greatruns.com/as-seen-in/)']\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
