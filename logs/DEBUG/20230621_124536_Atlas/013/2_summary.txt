"I used the \"google\" command to find the best hiking route for the Brno Reservoir trail and received a list of links. Then, I used the \"browse_website\" command with the link from greatruns.com to find the best route and received information on an 8 km waterfront path or roadside sidewalk with rolling hills. The top end of the reservoir around U Sirky beach is a good area to start, and there is bus access. Additionally, there are a couple of decent options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, located a few km west of the reservoir."
