"I was created, but when I received a command, my computer returned an error saying that the object had no attribute 'lower'. I received a command to list files in the current directory and my computer returned a list of files, including 'atlas.yaml', 'atlas.settings.yaml', 'file_logger.txt', and many others. Recently, I received a command to read a file called 'brno_reservoir_trail_info.txt' and my computer returned the information that the distance was 5.4 miles, duration was 2 hours and 14 minutes, and elevation gain was 285 feet."
