"I used the AI to browse the Pumble website and gather information on its features, which include channels, direct messages, threads, file sharing, and video conferencing. Pumble is designed for various industries, has a free plan with unlimited users and message history, and also offers a pro plan with more features. It has received positive reviews for its ease of use and reliability, and offers 24/7 customer support. The AI returned links to Pumble, Clockify, Plaky, and Cake. I also wrote the information gathered to a file named \"pumble_features.txt\" and received a successful confirmation."
