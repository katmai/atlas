"I was asked to browse the James Clear website for interesting articles on productivity. I received an answer from the website that there is a collection of science-based articles on various topics including productivity, creativity, habits, decision making, motivation, and self-improvement. The website also offers a free email course on building better habits and a newsletter with weekly wisdom. I also found links to the author's books and quotes."
