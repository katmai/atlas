"I asked the AI to Google productive things to do and found a website with a list of over 100 ideas. I then asked the AI to browse the website for more information, where I learned about the importance of rest and relaxation, trying new things, and self-improvement. The website also had an article on overcoming the planning fallacy and a personal account of following Benjamin Franklin's daily schedule. I saved this information to a file called \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and received confirmation that the file was written successfully. The website also promoted a free time tracking software called Clockify."
