I also asked the AI to Google interesting and productive things to do and found a website with a list of over 100 ideas. I then asked the AI to browse the website for more information, where I learned about the importance of rest and relaxation, trying new things, and self-improvement. The website also had an article on overcoming the planning fallacy and a personal account of following Benjamin Franklin's daily schedule. I saved this information to a file called \"productive_things_to_do.txt\" and received confirmation that the file was written successfully. The website also promoted a free time tracking software called Clockify.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"Clockify time tracking software\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://clockify.me/\", \"https://app.clockify.me/login\", \"https://clockify.me/time-tracker\", \"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clockify-time-tracker/pmjeegjhjdlccodhacdgbgfagbpmccpe\", \"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clockify-time-tracker/id1304431926\", \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.clockify.android&hl=en_US&gl=US\", \"https://www.usepixie.com/blog/track-time-in-pixie-with-clockify-free-time-tracking-software\", \"https://www.timecamp.com/blog/2021/06/free-clockify-alternatives/\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
