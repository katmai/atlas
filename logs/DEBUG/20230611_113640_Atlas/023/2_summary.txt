"I asked the AI to browse the Clockify website for its features. I learned that the software offers timekeeping, reporting, management, scheduling, and integration capabilities. It also allows users to track time using a timer or manually, log weekly activities, track GPS location, and record expenses. Additionally, it offers features for team communication and collaboration, project and task management, and time off tracking. The software is available for desktop and mobile devices and offers integrations with other apps. It is free to use with unlimited users and offers 24/7 support.
