The author emphasizes the importance of focusing on important tasks consistently rather than trying to do everything quickly. Other tips include managing energy, preparing the night before, avoiding email in the morning, working in a cool place, and developing a pre-game routine. The website also provides links to recommended productivity books, articles, newsletter, and quotes."
