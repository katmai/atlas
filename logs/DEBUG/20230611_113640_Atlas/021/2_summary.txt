"I asked the AI to read a file named \"eisenhower_box_notes.txt\" and learned about the Eisenhower Box strategy for prioritizing tasks. I then asked the AI to Google \"interesting and productive things to do\" and received a list of links, including one to a Clockify blog post. I asked the AI to browse the Clockify website and learned that it is a free time tracking software with various features and positive user reviews. I wrote a summary of Clockify's features and benefits to a file named \"clockify_info.txt\" and received confirmation that the file was successfully written to. I also found a website with a list of over 100 productive things to do and wrote a summary of it to a file named \"productive_things_to_do.txt\". I asked the AI to read the \"clockify_info.txt\" file and learned that Clockify is a free time tracking software with various features such as timekeeping, timesheets, calendar, auto tracker, reporting, management, invoicing, and expenses. It works across devices and can be used for boosting productivity, billing clients, managing teams, and streamlining processes. The software has received positive reviews from users and offers 24/7 customer support. Finally, I asked the AI to list all files in the current directory and received a list of file names including \"clockify_info.txt\" and \"productive_things_to_do.txt\"."
