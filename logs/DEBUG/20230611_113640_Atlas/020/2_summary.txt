"I asked the AI to read a file named \"eisenhower_box_notes.txt\" and learned about the Eisenhower Box strategy for prioritizing tasks. I then asked the AI to Google \"interesting and productive things to do\" and received a list of links, including one to a Clockify blog post. I asked the AI to browse the Clockify website and learned that it is a free time tracking software with various features and positive user reviews. I wrote a summary of Clockify's features and benefits to a file named \"clockify_info.txt\" and received confirmation that the file was successfully written to. I also found a website with a list of over 100 productive things to do and wrote a summary of it to a file named \"productive_things_to_do.txt\". Finally, I asked the AI to list all files in the current directory and received a list of file names including \"clockify_info.txt\" and \"productive_things_to_do.txt\"."
