"I browsed the James Clear website and found a productivity guide that defines productivity as completing important tasks consistently. The guide offers various strategies for productivity, including the Eisenhower Box, Warren Buffett's \"2 List\" Strategy, the Ivy Lee Method, and Anthony Trollope's 15-Minute Routine. The guide also provides simple ways to be more productive every day, such as managing energy, preparing the night before, and not opening email until noon. The website also offers links to the author's books, articles, newsletter, and quotes."
