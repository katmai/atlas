"I asked the AI to browse the James Clear website for productivity strategies and it found the Eisenhower Box, Warren Buffett's \"2 List\" Strategy, the Ivy Lee Method, and Anthony Trollope's 15-minute routine. I then wrote notes on the Eisenhower Box strategy and saved them to a file called \"eisenhower_box_notes.txt\". The strategy helps prioritize tasks into four categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important. This allows for focus on important tasks and avoiding wasting time on unimportant ones. The website also offers tips on energy management, preparation, and a pre-game routine, as well as links to recommended productivity resources."
