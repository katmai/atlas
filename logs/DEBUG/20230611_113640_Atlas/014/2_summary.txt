"I asked the AI to Google interesting and productive things to do. My computer returned a list of websites with suggestions. I then asked the AI to browse a specific website for more information on productive things to do. The website provided a list of over 100 productive things to do when bored, emphasizing the importance of rest and relaxation, and encouraging readers to try new things and improve themselves. It also includes an article on overcoming the planning fallacy and a personal account of following Benjamin Franklin's daily schedule, as well as promoting a free time tracking software called Clockify."
