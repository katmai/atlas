Pumble is designed for various industries, has a free plan with unlimited users and message history, and also offers a pro plan with more features. It has received positive reviews for its ease of use and reliability, and offers 24/7 customer support. The AI returned links to Pumble, Clockify, Plaky, and Cake. I also wrote the information gathered to a file named \"pumble_features.txt\" and received a successful confirmation. \n\nI read a file named \"eisenhower_box_notes.txt\" that contained information on the Eisenhower Box strategy, which helps prioritize tasks. I also used the AI to google \"interesting and productive things to do\" and found a website that provided a list of over 100 productive things to do when bored, which I wrote to a file named \"productive_things_to_do.txt\". I then googled \"Clockify time tracking software\" and used the AI to browse the Clockify website, which provided information on the software's features. I wrote this information to a file named \"clockify_info.txt\". I also used the AI to google \"Clockify time tracking software features\"\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"How to use Pumble app\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://pumble.com/help/getting-started/pumble-basics/getting-started-with-pumble-guide/\", \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pumble&hl=en_US&gl=US\", \"https://pumble.com/\", \"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pumble/id1536136725\", \"https://pumble.com/help/tutorials/pumble-101/how-to-get-started-with-pumble/\", \"https://www.getapp.com/collaboration-software/a/pumble/reviews/\", \"https://pumble.com/apps\", \"https://www.cloudwards.net/pumble-review/\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
