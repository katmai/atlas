"I used the AI to browse the Clockify website and gather information on its features, which include timekeeping, reporting, management, scheduling, and integration capabilities. The software allows users to track time using a timer or manually, log weekly activities, track GPS location, and record expenses. It also offers features for team communication and collaboration, project and task management, and time off tracking. The software is available for desktop and mobile devices and offers integrations with other apps. I then wrote this information to a file called \"clockify_features.txt\" and confirmed that it was successfully written. I also used the AI to read the file and confirmed that it contained the information on Clockify's features. Finally, I used the AI to search for information on the Pumble app."
