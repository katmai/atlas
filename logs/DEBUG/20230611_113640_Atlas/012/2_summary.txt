"I asked the AI to read my notes on the Eisenhower Box strategy from the file \"eisenhower_box_notes.txt\". The notes explained that the strategy helps prioritize tasks into four categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important. This allows for focus on important tasks and avoiding wasting time on unimportant ones."
