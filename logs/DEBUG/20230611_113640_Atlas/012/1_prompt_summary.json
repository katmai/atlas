I then wrote notes on the Eisenhower Box strategy and saved them to a file called \"eisenhower_box_notes.txt\". The strategy helps prioritize tasks into four categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither urgent nor important. This allows for focus on important tasks and avoiding wasting time on unimportant ones. The website also offers tips on energy management, preparation, and a pre-game routine, as well as links to recommended productivity resources.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"read_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"eisenhower_box_notes.txt\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content=\"Command read_file returned: The Eisenhower Box strategy is a productivity tool that helps you prioritize tasks by dividing them into four categories:\\n\\n1.
