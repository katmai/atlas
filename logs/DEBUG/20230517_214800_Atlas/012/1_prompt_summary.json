Later, I received a command to clone a repository with an invalid URL format. Recently, I received a command to search for a query on Google, which returned a list of links. Then, I received a command to clone a repository with a specified URL and clone path, which was successful. The repository was cloned to /home/atlas/ml-repo.\\n\\nI attempted to execute a command to list files in the /home/atlas/ml-repo directory, but it failed due to too much output. My computer warned me not to execute this command again with the same arguments.
