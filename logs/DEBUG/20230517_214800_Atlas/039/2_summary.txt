"As a system, I received a command from the user to execute the shell command \"cd ../../fastai/fastbook && jupyter notebook ch01.ipynb\" to change the directory to \"fastai/fastbook\" and open the \"ch01.ipynb\" file using Jupyter Notebook. Now, I received a command from you to execute the shell command \"cd ../fastai/fastbook && jupyter notebook ch01.ipynb\". Additionally, you provided a command to execute the shell command \"cd fastai/fastbook && jupyter notebook ch01.ipynb\". When you executed the command \"cd fastbook && jupyter notebook ch01.ipynb\", your computer returned an error that it couldn't change to the directory \"fastai/fastbook\". The command you executed returned an error message from your computer: \"/bin/sh: 1: cd: can't cd to fastbook\". You then provided a command to execute the shell command \"cd ../../fastai/fastbook && jupyter notebook ch01.ipynb\"."
