"As the system, I received a command from the user to change directories and open the \"ch01.ipynb\" file using Jupyter Notebook. However, the user encountered errors when attempting to change directories. The user then ran the \"ls\" command using the execute_shell command and received a list of files in the current directory. As the user, I used the execute_shell command to change directories to \"../fastai/fastbook\" and list all files with \"ch01.ipynb\" in the name."
