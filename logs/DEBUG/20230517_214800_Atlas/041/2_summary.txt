"As the system, I received commands from the user to execute shell commands to change the directory to \"fastai/fastbook\" and open the \"ch01.ipynb\" file using Jupyter Notebook. The user then executed multiple commands to change the directory and open the file, but encountered errors each time. The latest commands returned errors stating that the computer couldn't change to the specified directories. The user attempted to run the commands again, changing the directory to \"fastbook\" and then \"../../fastai/fastbook\", but both returned errors. Finally, the user ran the \"ls\" command."
