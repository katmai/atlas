We should use the 'execute_shell' command to navigate to the fastai/fastbook directory and list its contents to ensure that the nbs directory exists. This will help us determine if the nbs directory was not found because it does not exist or because the directory path was incorrect.",

        "criticism": "We should have used the 'execute_shell' command earlier in our exploration of the fastai/fastbook repository to ensure that the nbs directory exists before attempting to list its contents. We should prioritize using this command earlier in our future explorations.",
