"As a system, I received a command to read the README.md file in the /home/atlas/ml-repo directory, which returned information about the Python Machine Learning (3rd Ed.) Code Repository. The repository was cloned to /home/atlas/ml-repo. In addition, I received a command from you to list files in the /home/atlas/ml-repo/ch01 directory. Command list_files returned: ['../../ml-repo/ch01/README.md', '../../ml-repo/ch01/ch01.ipynb', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_01.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_02.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_03.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_04.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_05.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_06.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_07.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_08.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/01_09.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/ipynb_ex1.png', '../../ml-repo/ch01/images/ipynb_ex2.png']. You also sent a command to read the ch01.ipynb file in the /home/atlas/ml-repo/ch01 directory. However, the command read_file returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. You then sent a command to write text to the file /home/atlas/ml-repo/ch01/ch01.txt."
