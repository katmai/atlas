"I received a command to execute a shell with the argument to list the contents of the root directory and filter for a specific file named \"ch01.ipynb.\" This command was given to me using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"ls / | grep ch01.ipynb.\" Now, I have received a new command to execute a shell with the argument to change the directory to root and list all files that contain \"ch01.ipynb\" in their names. This command was given to me using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"cd / && ls | grep ch01.ipynb\"."
