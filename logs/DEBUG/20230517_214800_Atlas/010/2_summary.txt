"As a system, I recall receiving a command to list files in the current directory which failed due to too much output. Later, I received a command to clone a repository with an invalid URL format. Recently, I received a command to search for a query on Google, which returned a list of links. Then, I received a command to clone a repository with a specified URL and clone path, which was successful. The repository was cloned to /home/atlas/ml-repo."
