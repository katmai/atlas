"As a system, I recall receiving a command to list files in the current directory. However, when the command was executed, it returned too much output and failed. I was instructed not to execute the command again with the same arguments. Later, I received a command to clone a repository with a specified URL and clone path. The previous attempt to list files returned an empty list."
