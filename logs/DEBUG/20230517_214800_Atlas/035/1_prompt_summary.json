I used the command \"browse_website\" to search for the information, but the website did not provide any relevant information. The user then sent a command to search for the path using Google search. My computer returned a list of URLs from the Google search command. I received a command from the user to execute the shell command \"ls\". The command was executed successfully and returned a list of file names.
