We should use the 'execute_shell' command to navigate to the fastai directory and list its contents to ensure that the fastbook directory exists.

        "criticism": "We should have used the 'execute_shell' command earlier in our exploration of the fastai repository to ensure that the fastbook directory exists before attempting to navigate to it. We should prioritize using this command earlier in our future explorations.",
