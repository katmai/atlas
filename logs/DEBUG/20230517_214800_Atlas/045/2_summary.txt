"As I attempted to change directories to \"../fastai/fastbook\" and list all files with \"ch01.ipynb\" in the name using the execute_shell command, it returned an error stating that it couldn't change directories. However, upon running the command again, it returned STDOUT: '' and STDERR: \"/bin/sh: 1: cd: can't cd to fastai/fastbook\\n\". To troubleshoot, I ran the command \"cd / && ls | grep ch01.ipynb\" using the execute_shell command."
