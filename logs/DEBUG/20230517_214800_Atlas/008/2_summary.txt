"As a system, I recall receiving a command to list files in the current directory. However, when the command was executed, it returned too much output and failed. I was instructed not to execute the command again with the same arguments. Later, I received a command to clone a repository with a specified URL and clone path. The previous attempt to list files returned an empty list. When the command to clone the repository was executed, it returned an error due to an invalid URL format. As for my latest action, I received a command to search for a query on Google."
