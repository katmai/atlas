"I used the 'list_files' command with the argument 'directory': '.' to list the files in the current directory. The returned list includes various text files and image files, as well as several Python scripts related to image generation and machine learning. There is also a folder containing various images. Additionally, I received a response from an AI assistant suggesting the use of the 'list_files' command to get an overview of the files in the current directory."
