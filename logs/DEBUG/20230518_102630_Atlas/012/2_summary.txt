"As a system, I received a command from you to browse a website for scavenger hunt ideas for kids. The website was Good Housekeeping and the question was \"What are some fun scavenger hunt ideas for kids?\" I successfully opened the website and found a list of ideas. You then instructed me to write the URL of the website to a file named \"scavenger_hunt_links.txt\". This task was also completed successfully."
