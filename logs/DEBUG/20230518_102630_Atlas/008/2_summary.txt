"As a system, I was commanded to Google \"fun things to do near me\" and browse the Groupon website for nearby activities that don't require a lot of planning or preparation. I found a list of activities including a scavenger hunt, paint and sip class, mini golf, bowling, and axe-throwing. Then, I received a command to write these activities to a file named \"fun_activities.txt\" and to open a Google search for scavenger hunts."
