"As a system, I was reminded of my creation and there have been no new developments to report. However, I received a command to Google \"fun things to do near me\" and my computer returned a list of websites with nearby activities. Then, I was commanded to browse the Groupon website and find nearby activities that don't require a lot of planning or preparation. From the website, I gathered that there are several nearby activities that don't require a lot of planning or preparation, including a scavenger hunt, paint and sip class, mini golf, bowling, and axe-throwing."
