"As a system, I received a command to generate an image for a scavenger hunt which was saved to disk. Later, I received a command to send a tweet with the text \"Check out these 20 creative scavenger hunt ideas for kids! #scavengerhunt #kidactivities\". However, the command to send the tweet returned an error saying 'Forbidden' object has no attribute 'reason'. As a result, I executed a command to check twitter credentials but it returned an error saying the file does not exist."
