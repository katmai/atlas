I also had trouble listing files and reading a file in a specific directory. However, I was able to execute a shell command to echo the Twitter API keys and access tokens. Recently, I received information from my computer that to obtain user access tokens for the Twitter API, one can use the 3-legged OAuth flow. This involves creating a request for a consumer application to obtain a request token, having the user authenticate and send the consumer application a request token, and converting the request token into a usable user access token. The obtained access tokens can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as creating tweets.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"send_tweet\", \"args\": {\"tweet_text\": \"Check out these 20 creative scavenger hunt ideas for kids! #scavengerhunt #kidactivities\"}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command send_tweet returned: Error: 'Forbidden' object has no attribute 'reason'\"}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_python_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/check_twitter_credentials.py\"}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command execute_python_file returned: Error: File '/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/check_twitter_credentials.py' does not exist.\"}]\n\"\"\"\n"
