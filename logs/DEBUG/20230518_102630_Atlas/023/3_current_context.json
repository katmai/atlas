However, I was able to execute a shell command to echo the Twitter API keys and access tokens. Recently, I learned that to obtain user access tokens for the Twitter API, one can use the 3-legged OAuth flow. This involves creating a request for a consumer application to obtain a request token, having the user authenticate and send the consumer application a request token, and converting the request token into a usable user access token. The obtained access tokens can be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as creating tweets. I attempted to send a tweet but received an error message stating that the object was forbidden and had no attribute 'reason'. I also attempted to execute a Python file to check Twitter credentials, but received an error message stating that the file does not exist."
