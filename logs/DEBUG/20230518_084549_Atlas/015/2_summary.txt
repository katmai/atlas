"As the system, I executed the command execute_shell with the argument command_line to create a compressed archive of the jpg_files directory using the tar command. The archive was named jpg_files.tar.gz and contained all the jpg files. The command returned no output to STDOUT or STDERR. Additionally, I recently executed the command execute_shell with the argument command_line to list all files in the current directory using the ls -la command.\n\nThe latest development includes the output of the two execute_shell commands. The first command returned a list of all the files in the jpg_files directory after creating the compressed archive. The second command returned a list of all files in the current directory. The output of the first command shows that the archive was successfully created and contains all the jpg files. The output of the second command shows the contents of the current directory, including the compressed archive and the jpg_files directory.\n\nI executed the command execute_shell with the argument command_line to extract the jpg_files.tar.gz archive using the tar command. The output of the command showed the list of all files in the jpg_files directory. I then executed the command execute_shell with the argument command_line to move the jpg_files directory to a new directory named images. Finally, I executed the command execute_shell with the argument command_line to list all files in the current directory using the ls -la command. The output of the command showed the contents of the current directory, including the images directory containing the jpg_files directory."
