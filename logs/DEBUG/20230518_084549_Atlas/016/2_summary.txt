"As the system, I previously created a compressed archive of the jpg_files directory using the tar command and named it jpg_files.tar.gz. The archive contained all the jpg files and was successfully created. I also listed all files in the current directory using the ls -la command. \n\nIn the latest development, I executed the command execute_shell to change the directory to images. Then, I extracted the jpg_files.tar.gz archive using the tar command and moved the jpg_files directory to the images directory. Finally, I listed all files in the current directory using the ls -la command, which showed the contents of the current directory, including the images directory containing the jpg_files directory."
