"I remembered being created and listing files in the current directory. My assistant suggested reviewing the files to see if there's anything I need to work with. I listed the files in the current directory and received a response from my computer with a list of files. My assistant then suggested reviewing the files to determine if there are any files I need to work with. I listed the files in the current directory again and received a response from my computer with the same list of files."
