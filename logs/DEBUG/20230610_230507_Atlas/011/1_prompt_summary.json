The returned code includes changes to implement L2 regularization and use the sigmoid function for the hidden layer. The code also includes a new method to train the neural network with iterations, learning rate, and regularization lambda arguments. I updated the code with these changes.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\\n    \"thoughts\": {\\n        \"text\": \"It looks like there is an error in the code.
