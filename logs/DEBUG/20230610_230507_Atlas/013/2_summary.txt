"I received an error message stating that the 'NeuralNetwork' class was not defined. I used the 'analyze_code' command with the focus on identifying the source of the error in the code. The AI response provided a suggestion for how to define the 'NeuralNetwork' class with necessary methods. I made the necessary changes and the code now includes the definition of the 'NeuralNetwork' class with the required methods."
