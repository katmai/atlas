"I was commanded to browse a website and gather information on AI. The website provided an overview of AI but did not answer the question. I received a new command to summarize information on AI from a different website. The command returned a collection of various sources and articles covering the history, development, subfields, applications, risks, and ethical implications of AI. It also discussed related fields such as cybernetics and emerging technologies. The information provided a broad overview of the current state and future potential of AI, including discussions on machine learning, neural networks, robotics, and the impact of AI on society and employment."
