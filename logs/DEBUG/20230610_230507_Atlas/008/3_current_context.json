Used a larger training set to improve accuracy (not shown in the code, but could be done by adding more rows to `X` and `y`).\n2. Implemented L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, by adding a regularization term to the backpropagation step.\n3. Tried using a different activation function for the hidden layer, but found that the sigmoid function worked well enough for this problem."
