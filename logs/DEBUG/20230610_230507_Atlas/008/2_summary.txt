"I received an error message when attempting to execute the Python file \"ai_code.py\". The error was due to an unexpected keyword argument in the \"sigmoid\" function. I successfully replaced the function with an updated version that includes the \"derivative\" argument. I then executed the file again and received a result of [[0.97573201], [0.97573201], [0.97573201], [0.97573201]]."
