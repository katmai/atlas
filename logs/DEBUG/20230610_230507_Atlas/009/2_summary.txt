"I received a message to improve the code, which included suggestions to use a larger training set, implement regularization, and try a different activation function. The returned code includes changes to implement L2 regularization and use the sigmoid function for the hidden layer. The code also includes a new method to train the neural network with iterations, learning rate, and regularization lambda arguments. I updated the code with these changes."
