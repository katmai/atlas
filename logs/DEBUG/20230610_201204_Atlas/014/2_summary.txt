"I received a suggestion from the AI assistant to use the `list_files` command to find a specific file or check if a file exists. I used the command with the directory argument of \"/\" and successfully listed the files in the directory. However, when I tried to execute a shell command with the path to a script, I received an error message stating that the file or directory does not exist."
