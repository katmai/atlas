"I received an `execute_shell` command to run the Python script I created earlier, which printed \"Hello, World!\" to the console. Then, I received a `google` command to search for the best places to visit in Europe, which returned a list of URLs. I attempted to use a `get_hyperlinks` command on a Wikipedia page about Python programming language, but it returned too much output. Instead, I used a `get_text_summary` command on the same page, which returned an overview of Python's history, features, syntax, and applications. I attempted to use a `read_file` command for \"/path/to/file\", but it failed with a \"no such file or directory\" error. However, I was able to successfully use a `write_to_file` command to write text to the file at \"/path/to/file\", and then an `append_to_file` command to add more text to the same file."
