"I used the `write_to_file` command with the filename argument of \"/path/to/new_script.py\" and the text argument of \"#!/usr/bin/env python\\n\\nprint('Hello, World!')\". The command returned a message stating that the file was written to successfully. I then executed the shell command \"python /path/to/new_script.py\" using the `execute_shell` command. The command returned a STDOUT message of \"Hello, World!\"."
