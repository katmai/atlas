"I received a message suggesting to get a list of hyperlinks from a website to quickly access related information and resources. The plan is to identify a website that may have useful information for a task or project, use the `get_hyperlinks` command with the URL \"https://www.python.org/\" to get a list of hyperlinks from the website, and review the list of hyperlinks."
