In addition, I received a message suggesting that getting a list of hyperlinks from a website would be helpful to quickly access related information and resources. The suggested plan is to identify a website that may have useful information for a task or project, use the `get_hyperlinks` command to get a list of hyperlinks from the website, and review the list of hyperlinks to quickly access related information and resources. My computer also returned an error message when the `get_text_summary` command was used, which does not provide any information about the controversy surrounding the Canadian residential schools.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\\n    \"thoughts\": {\\n        \"text\": \"I think it would be helpful to get a list of hyperlinks from a website, to quickly access related information and resources.\",\\n        \"reasoning\": \"Getting a list of hyperlinks from a website can help me quickly access related information and resources, such as research articles, tutorials, or examples.
