"I used the `google` command with the argument of \"best places to visit in Europe\" and received a list of URLs containing information on the best places to visit. I then attempted to use the `get_hyperlinks` command with the argument of \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\" but received a failure message stating that the command returned too much output and should not be executed with the same arguments again."
