"I successfully used the \"write_to_file\" command to write \"This is the text to write to the file.\" to the file at \"/path/to/file\". I executed the \"execute_shell\" command to run a Python script and received a \"Hello, World!\" output. I used the \"google\" command to search for the best places to visit in Europe and received a list of URLs. I attempted to use the \"get_hyperlinks\" command, but it failed due to too much output. I used the \"get_text_summary\" command to get an overview of Python programming language from Wikipedia. I attempted to use the \"list_files\" command on a non-existent directory and received an error. I then successfully used the \"write_to_file\" command to write \"This is the new text to write to the file.\" to the file at \"/path/to/file\", followed by using the \"append_to_file\" command to append \" This is the text to append to the file.\" to the same file. Lastly, I attempted to use the \"replace_in_file\" command, but it failed to find the specified text."
