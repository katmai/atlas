"I used the `google` command with the argument of \"best places to visit in Europe\" and received a list of URLs containing information on the best places to visit. I then attempted to use the `get_hyperlinks` command with the argument of \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\" but received a failure message stating that the command returned too much output and should not be executed with the same arguments again. \n\nI received a message from the AI with a `get_text_summary` command for the URL \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\" and the question \"What is Python?\". The command returned an overview of the Python programming language, including its history, features, syntax, and various implementations. It highlights Python's versatility and popularity in a wide range of applications, such as scientific computing, web development, and artificial intelligence. The text also includes resources and references related to Python, such as books and software libraries."
