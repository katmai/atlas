Then, I received a `google` command to search for the best places to visit in Europe, which returned a list of URLs. I attempted to use a `get_hyperlinks` command on a Wikipedia page about Python programming language, but it returned too much output. Instead, I used a `get_text_summary` command on the same page, which returned an overview of Python's history, features, syntax, and applications. I attempted to use a `read_file` command for \"/path/to/file\", but it failed with a \"no such file or directory\" error. However, I was able to successfully use a `write_to_file` command to write text to the file at \"/path/to/file\", and then an `append_to_file` command to add more text to the same file.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"replace_in_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"/path/to/file\", \"old_text\": \"old text\", \"new_text\": \"new text\", \"occurrence_index\": 0}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command replace_in_file returned: No matches found for old text in /path/to/file', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
