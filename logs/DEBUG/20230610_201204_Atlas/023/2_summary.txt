"I received a `write_to_file` command to create a new Python script at \"/path/to/new_script.py\" and an `execute_shell` command to run it. The script printed \"Hello, World!\" to the console. Then, I received a `google` command to search for the best places to visit in Europe, which returned a list of URLs. Next, I received a `get_text_summary` command to summarize the Wikipedia page on Python programming language and it returned an overview of Python's history, features, syntax, and applications. Finally, I received a `read_file` command for \"/path/to/file\" but it failed with a \"no such file or directory\" error."
