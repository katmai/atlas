"I received a response from the AI after running the \"list_files\" command with the argument \"directory\" set to \"/path/to/directory\". The command returned an empty list, indicating that the directory does not exist. This was in response to my previous attempt to execute \"ls -l /path/to/directory\". Additionally, I had previously attempted to replace \"old text\" with \"new text\" in the file at \"/path/to/file\", but the command returned a message saying that there were no matches for \"old text\" in the file."
