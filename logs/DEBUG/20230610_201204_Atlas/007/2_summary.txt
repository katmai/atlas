"I received a message to analyze code, but since I did not have any code to analyze, my computer provided a sample implementation of the `analyze_code` function that checks for unnecessary imports, unused variables, and long lines of code and returns a list of suggestions for improvements. In addition, I received a message suggesting that getting a list of hyperlinks from a website would be helpful to quickly access related information and resources. The suggested plan is to identify a website that may have useful information for a task or project, use the `get_hyperlinks` command to get a list of hyperlinks from the website, and review the list of hyperlinks to quickly access related information and resources. My computer also returned an error message when the `get_text_summary` command was used, which does not provide any information about the controversy surrounding the Canadian residential schools."
