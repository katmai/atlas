"I received an error message when using the `get_text_summary` command. The AI assistant suggested using the `list_files` command to quickly find a specific file or check if a file exists. I followed the plan and used the `list_files` command with the directory argument of \"/\" to list the files in the directory. The command returned a list of files in the directory."
