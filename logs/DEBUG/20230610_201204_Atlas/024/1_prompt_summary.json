Next, I received a `get_text_summary` command to summarize the Wikipedia page on Python programming language and it returned an overview of Python's history, features, syntax, and applications. Finally, I received a `read_file` command for \"/path/to/file\" but it failed with a \"no such file or directory\" error.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"write_to_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"/path/to/file\", \"text\": \"This is the text to write to the file.\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
