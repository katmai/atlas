I also executed the \"google\" command which returned a list of URLs for the best places to visit in Europe. I attempted to use the \"get_hyperlinks\" command but it failed due to too much output. I executed the \"replace_in_file\" command to replace the old text in the file at \"/path/to/file\" with the newest text. I used the \"execute_shell\" command to list all files in the current directory. I attempted to use the \"list_files\" command to list all files in a directory but it returned an empty list. Therefore, I used the \"execute_shell\" command with the command_line argument set to \"ls -al\" to list all files in the current directory. The command returned a list of all files in the current directory."
