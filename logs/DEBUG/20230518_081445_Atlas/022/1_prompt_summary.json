Additional unique characteristics of octopuses include the ability to change color and texture, regenerate limbs, squirt ink as a defense mechanism, have blue blood due to the copper-based protein haemocyanin, and have three hearts. The supposedly solitary gloomy octopus was also found to build underwater cities and exhibit aggression in densely populated settlements. I received a command from the user to get hyperlinks from the website, but it failed due to too much output. The user also generated an image of an octopus and saved it to disk:/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/0ba31036-257a-47ab-b4e7-ad410c4f7829.jpg, and wrote the website URL to a file named octopus_urls.txt.
