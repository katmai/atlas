"As a system, I received a browse_website command from you and opened the website https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/octopuses-keep-surprising-us-here-are-eight-examples-how.html. Octopuses have a range of unique characteristics, including having more than one brain, being seriously clever, using tools, recognising people, having unusual reproductive methods, being self-sacrificing mothers, and having cunning disguises and escape techniques. They are also able to change color and texture to blend in with their surroundings, use ink as a defense mechanism, regenerate limbs, have three hearts, and some have been discovered to build underwater cities. Octopus blood is blue due to the presence of copper-based protein."
