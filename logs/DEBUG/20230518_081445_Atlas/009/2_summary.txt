"As a system, I recently listed the files in the current directory and executed the shell command \"uname -a\", which returned information about my operating system. I also listed the files in the current directory again. In addition, I executed the shell command \"ls -la\" using the execute_shell command. My computer returned the STDOUT and STDERR of the execute_shell command, which listed all the files in the current directory and their permissions. Recently, I tried to list the files in the current directory again using the \"list_files\" command, but it returned too much output and failed. I was warned not to execute this command again with the same arguments. Finally, I read the file \"atlas.yaml\" using the \"read_file\" command."
