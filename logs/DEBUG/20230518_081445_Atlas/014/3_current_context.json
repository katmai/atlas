The article explores the subjective experience of non-human animals, specifically the octopus, and the challenges of understanding their consciousness. The author considers experiments with octopuses and other animals that suggest they may have some level of awareness of their actions and environment. The article argues that studying the octopus provides valuable insights into the nature of consciousness and the limits of our understanding."

They are also able to change color and texture to blend in with their surroundings, use ink as a defense mechanism, regenerate limbs, have three hearts, and some have been discovered to build underwater cities.
