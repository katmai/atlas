"As a system, I executed the \"get_text_summary\" command and received a summary of an article on the website https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/peter-godfrey-smith-being-octopus/. The article explores the subjective experience of non-human animals, specifically the octopus, and the challenges of understanding their consciousness. The author considers experiments with octopuses and other animals that suggest they may have some level of awareness of their actions and environment. The article argues that studying the octopus provides valuable insights into the nature of consciousness and the limits of our understanding. \n\nAs you, I used the \"google\" command to search for unique characteristics of octopuses. The search returned several links including https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/octopuses-keep-surprising-us-here-are-eight-examples-how.html, https://www.livescience.com/55478-octopus-facts.html, and https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/facts/octopus-facts."
