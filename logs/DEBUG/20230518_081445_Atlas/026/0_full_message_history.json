Octopuses have a large nervous system that evolved on a different path from our own, with most of their neurons located in their arms rather than their central brain. This makes it difficult to determine whether an octopus experiences its arms as parts of itself or as parts of its environment. Understanding what it is like to be an octopus requires using memory and imagination to draw analogies with our own experiences and behaviors. The text discusses the unique experience of being an octopus, including the mixing of centrally and peripherally controlled movements and the blurring of the border between self and environment. The author also explores the concept of agency and whether non-human animals, such as octopuses, are capable of distinguishing between events they cause and those they do not. The text references experiments with chimps and monkeys that suggest some animals may have awareness of agency. Overall, the text argues that understanding the experience of being an octopus is a difficult but worthwhile endeavor. \n \n Links: ['\\n\\nSign Up\\n\\n (https://us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=aea7c9cffc2113645a66ab631&id=2cb428c5ad)', '\\n  (https://www.bostonreview.net/)', ' (https://www.facebook.com/bostonreview/)', ' (https://twitter.com/BostonReview/)', ' (https://www.facebook.com/bostonreview/)']"
