"As a system, I recently executed the \"read_file\" command and received information about the AI's goals and role from the \"atlas.yaml\" file. My computer returned the STDOUT and STDERR of the execute_shell command, which listed all the files in the current directory and their permissions. I was warned not to execute the \"list_files\" command again with the same arguments."
