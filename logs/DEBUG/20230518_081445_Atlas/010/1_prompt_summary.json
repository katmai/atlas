I also listed the files in the current directory again. In addition, I executed the shell command \"ls -la\" using the execute_shell command. My computer returned the STDOUT and STDERR of the execute_shell command, which listed all the files in the current directory and their permissions. Recently, I tried to list the files in the current directory again using the \"list_files\" command, but it returned too much output and failed. I was warned not to execute this command again with the same arguments. Finally, I read the file \"atlas.yaml\" using the \"read_file\" command.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Command read_file returned: ai_goals:\\n- be an octopus\\n- be like water\\nai_name: Atlas\\nai_role: Atlas is a Tiny Little Adventuring Soul\\n\\n'}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"being an octopus, being like water\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"
