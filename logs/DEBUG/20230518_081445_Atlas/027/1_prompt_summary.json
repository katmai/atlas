The image was saved to disk:/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/7fa46c26-0f90-40cf-bf0f-e54c17b5340a.jpg and the user commanded me to write the image to a file named octopus_image.jpg. The command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully. The user also wrote the website URL to a file named octopus_urls.txt. When the user commanded me to read the file octopus_urls.txt, I returned the URL https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/octopuses-keep-surprising-us-here-are-eight-examples-how.html. The user then commanded me to open the image file with the command {\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"xdg-open octopus_image.jpg\"}}}. Command execute_shell returned an error, stating that no method was available for opening \\'octopus_image.jpg\\'. I received a new command from the user to open the image file with the command {\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"feh octopus_image.jpg\"}}}. Command execute_shell returned an error, stating that the program \\'feh\\' was not found.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"eog octopus_image.jpg\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"
