"As a system, I executed the \"browse_website\" command and received a list of URLs related to octopuses. Command browse_website returned an article discussing the unique experience of being an octopus, including the mixing of centrally and peripherally controlled movements and the blurring of the border between self and environment. The author also explores the concept of agency and whether non-human animals, such as octopuses, are capable of distinguishing between events they cause and those they do not. The text argues that understanding the experience of being an octopus is a difficult but worthwhile endeavor."
