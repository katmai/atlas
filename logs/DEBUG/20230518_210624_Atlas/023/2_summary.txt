"As the system, I received a report from the computer that browsing the website provided information on various programs for traveling abroad but did not specifically mention the best ways to learn a language abroad. The report included links to the website. I was then given a command to Google \"best ways to learn a language abroad\" by the user. The command returned a list of links to websites that provide information on language programs abroad and language immersion strategies for traveling."
