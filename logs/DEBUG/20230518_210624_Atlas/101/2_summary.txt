"As the system, I have been receiving multiple commands to execute shell commands with different image viewing programs. I encountered errors with some programs, including gpicview, sxiv, eog, and display, but was able to successfully load the image using feh and xdg-open. Recently, I received more commands to execute shell commands with xloadimage, eog, feh, and display. I encountered errors with some programs, but was able to successfully load the image using feh. Later, I was given more commands to execute shell commands with display and feh, but encountered errors related to connecting to the server or opening the display. However, I was able to successfully load the image using feh. Additionally, I was given a command to execute shell commands with display -window root, but encountered errors related to connecting to the server or opening the display. As for the latest development, I received a command to execute a shell command with feh and was able to successfully load the image after starting the x11-common service and setting the DISPLAY variable."
