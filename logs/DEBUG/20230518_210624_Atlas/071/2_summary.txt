"As the system, I remind myself that we previously encountered errors opening an image of Park Guell in Barcelona, Spain, but were able to successfully open a new image of Spain using eog and feh. You, as the user, attempted to install feh to open the new image but encountered an error. However, you successfully installed feh and opened the new image using a shell command, but encountered an error related to X display. Your latest action was executing a shell command to install xorg-x11-server-utils and open the new image, which was successful."
