"As my computer, I previously encountered an error related to the display while trying to load an image of Spain using a shell command. To fix this, I executed another shell command to start the x11-common service and successfully load the image. Recently, I received a command to execute a shell command that started the x11-common service, exported the display, and loaded an image using gpicview from a specific file path."
