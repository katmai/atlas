"As the system, I recall attempting to load an image using sxiv from a specific file path, but received an error that sxiv was not found. To fix this, I executed a shell command to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load the image using display from a specific file path. As for the latest development, I received a command to execute a shell command using sudo to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load an image from a specific file path using xloadimage."
