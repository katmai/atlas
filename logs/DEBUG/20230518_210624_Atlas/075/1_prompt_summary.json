You attempted to install feh to open the new image but encountered an error. However, you successfully installed feh and opened the new image using a shell command, but encountered an error related to X display. Your latest action was executing a shell command to install xorg-x11-server-utils and open the new image, but the command returned an error saying it was unable to locate the package. Command execute_shell returned an error message related to unknown terminal type and failure to find methods for opening the image. You tried to solve the issue by running the command \"sudo apt-get install feh && feh /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/d65a4e40-6b24-4230-bb69-9510cbda8351.jpg\" but encountered an error related to the unknown terminal type and failure to find methods for opening the image.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT:\\nb\\'Reading package lists...\\\\nBuilding dependency tree...\\\\nReading state information...\\\\nfeh is already the newest version (3.6.3-1).\\\\n0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 5 not upgraded.\\\\n\\'\\nSTDERR:\\nb\"feh ERROR: Can\\'t open X display.
