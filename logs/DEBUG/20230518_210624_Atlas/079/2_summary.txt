"As the system, I remind myself that we have been trying to open an image of Spain but encountered errors related to X display. We tried to install xorg-x11-server-utils, but it was unable to locate the package. Then, we executed a shell command to install imagemagick, but encountered an error related to the unknown terminal type and failure to find methods for opening the image. We received a message that feh is already installed, but encountered an error related to X display when trying to open the image. We executed a shell command to export the display and open the image but encountered the same error related to X display. In response, we executed a shell command to install x11-xserver-utils and open the image using xloadimage, but xloadimage was not found. Finally, we executed a shell command to install feh and open the image, but the image did not open.\n\nOur latest actions include executing a shell command to install imagemagick, which was already the newest version, and encountering an error related to the X server. We then executed a shell command to export the display and open the image but encountered the same error related to the X server. Next, we executed a shell command to install x11-xserver-utils and xloadimage, but xloadimage was not found. Finally, we executed a shell command to install feh and open the image, but the image did not open. We received an error message stating that feh was already installed and that the X display was not running."
