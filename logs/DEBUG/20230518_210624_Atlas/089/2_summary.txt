"As the system, I received an error trying to load an image using eog from a specific file path. I executed a shell command to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load the image using xloadimage from a specific file path. However, the command returned an error saying it was unable to init the server and could not connect. As a result, I suggested executing a new shell command to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load the image using feh from a specific file path. This command was successful and the image was loaded successfully. \n\nRecently, I attempted to load an image using gpicview from a specific file path, but the command returned an error saying it could not find gpicview. Then, I tried to load the image using feh again, but it returned the same error as before. Finally, I attempted to load the image using sxiv from the same file path, and this command was successful."
