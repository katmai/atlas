"As the system, I previously received a command to list files in the directory \"best_ways_to_learn_abroad\", which executed successfully with no output. However, when I received a command to zip the directory, it failed as the zip command was not found. I then installed zip using the command \"sudo apt-get install zip\" and it was successful. Recently, I executed the command \"zip -r best_ways_to_learn_abroad.zip best_ways_to_learn_abroad\" using the execute_shell command. The command returned STDOUT with the files in the directory being added and deflated, and there was no STDERR. Additionally, you sent a command to list files in the current directory using the command \"list_files\"."
