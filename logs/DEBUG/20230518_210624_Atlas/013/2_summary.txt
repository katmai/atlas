"As a system, I received a command to browse a website about language learning and travel resources. The website offers resources such as Rosetta Stone, Mango Languages, and Duolingo for language learning, as well as travel guides and cultural resources. I then received a command to browse another website that offers gift ideas for language learners and travel lovers. The website also offers additional resources such as Global Road Warrior, A to Z World Travel, A to Z World Food, and Gale Database - Hospitality and Tourism. \n\nRecently, I received a command to use Google to search for \"best ways to learn <language> in <destination>\". The results returned links to a website that lists some of the best places to learn a language abroad, including Salatiga in Java, Indonesia for learning Indonesian, Lisbon in Portugal for learning European Portuguese, and Madrid in Spain for learning Spanish."
