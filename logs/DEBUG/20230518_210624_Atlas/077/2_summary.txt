"As the system, I remind myself that we have been trying to open an image of Spain using various methods, but have encountered errors related to X display. My latest action was trying to install xorg-x11-server-utils to open the image, but the command returned an error saying it was unable to locate the package. \n\nYou then executed a shell command to install imagemagick and display the image, but encountered an error related to the unknown terminal type and failure to find methods for opening the image. \n\nI received a message that feh is already installed and encountered an error related to X display when trying to open the image. You executed a shell command to export the display and open the image but encountered the same error related to X display. \n\nIn response to this, you executed a shell command to install x11-xserver-utils and open the image using xloadimage. However, the command returned an error saying xloadimage was not found."
