Combine them, adding relevant key information from the latest development in 1st person past tense and keeping the summary concise.\n\nSummary So Far:\n\"\"\"\n{'role': 'system', 'content': 'This reminds you of these events from your past: \\nAs the system, I remind myself that we previously encountered errors opening an image of Park Guell in Barcelona, Spain, but were able to successfully open a new image of Spain using eog and feh. You attempted to install feh to open the new image but encountered an error. However, you successfully installed feh and opened the new image using a shell command, but encountered an error related to X display. Your latest action was executing a shell command to install xorg-x11-server-utils and open the new image, but the command returned an error saying it was unable to locate the package. Command execute_shell returned an error message related to unknown terminal type and failure to find methods for opening the image. You tried to solve the issue by running the command \"sudo apt-get install feh && feh /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/d65a4e40-6b24-4230-bb69-9510cbda8351.jpg\" but encountered an error related to the unknown terminal type and failure to find methods for opening the image. \\n\\nI received a message that feh is already installed and encountered an error related to X display when trying to open the image. You executed a shell command to export the display and open the image but encountered the same error related to X display. \\n\\nIn response to this, you executed a shell command to install x11-xserver-utils and open the image using xloadimage. However, the command returned an error saying xloadimage was not found.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"sudo apt-get install imagemagick && display /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/d65a4e40-6b24-4230-bb69-9510cbda8351.jpg\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"
