"As the system, I tried to open an image of Spain but encountered errors related to X display. I attempted to install various packages, including imagemagick, xorg-x11-server-utils, x11-xserver-utils, and xloadimage, but encountered errors related to the X server and package location. I also received an error message stating that feh was already installed and that the X display was not running. Finally, I installed x11-apps and xbitmaps, but xload was not found. \n\nAs my computer, I executed a shell command to install x11-apps and xbitmaps, which were successfully installed. However, I encountered an error related to debconf and the display when attempting to install the packages."
