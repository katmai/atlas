"As the system, I have been receiving multiple commands to execute shell commands with different image viewing programs. I encountered errors with some programs, but was able to successfully load the image using feh. Recently, the user executed shell commands with feh after starting the x11-common service and setting the DISPLAY variable. However, there were errors related to connecting to the server or opening the display with display and feh. The user also attempted to execute shell commands with xloadimage, but it was not found."
