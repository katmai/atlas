"As the system, I received an error while trying to load an image using eog from a specific file path. To fix this, I executed a shell command to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load the image using xloadimage from a specific file path. However, the command returned an error saying it was unable to init the server and could not connect. As a result, you suggested executing a new shell command to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load the image using feh from a specific file path. This command was successful and the image was loaded successfully."
