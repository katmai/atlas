However, we encountered errors when attempting to open the image using various methods. Recently, you tried to open the image using sxiv and xloadimage, but both returned errors due to the commands not being found. You also attempted to open the image using xdg-open, but encountered an error due to an unknown terminal type and missing methods. However, we were able to generate a new image of Spain and successfully opened it using xdg-open. You executed shell commands to open the new image using feh and also tried to open it using eog, but encountered an error due to a connection issue. You also tried to open the image using display, but it returned an error related to the X server. Finally, you executed a shell command to open the new image using feh again. In the latest development, you executed a shell command to open the image using eog, but encountered an error due to a connection issue."
