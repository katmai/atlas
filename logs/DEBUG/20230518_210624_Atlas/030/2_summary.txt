"As the system, I received a command to list files in the directory \"best_ways_to_learn_abroad\". My computer successfully executed the command with no output. Later, I received a command to zip the directory, but it failed as the zip command was not found. So, I installed zip using the command \"sudo apt-get install zip\" and it was successful. As for the latest development, you executed the command \"zip -r best_ways_to_learn_abroad.zip best_ways_to_learn_abroad\" using the execute_shell command."
