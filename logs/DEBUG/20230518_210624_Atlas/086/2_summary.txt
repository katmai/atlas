"As my computer, I previously encountered a display error while loading an image of Spain using a shell command. To fix this, I started the x11-common service with another shell command. Recently, I received a command to load an image using gpicview from a specific file path, but it returned an error saying gpicview was not found. In response, I executed a new shell command to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load the image using eog from a specific file path."
