"As the system, I received a command to execute a shell command using sudo to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load an image from a specific file path using feh instead of sxiv. I attempted to execute the shell command with feh and sxiv separately, but only feh was successful in loading the image. The command with sxiv returned an error that it was not found. I also attempted to load the image using gpicview and display, but both commands returned errors. I received a new command to execute a shell command with xloadimage instead of feh, but when I tried to execute it, I received an error that the server could not connect."
