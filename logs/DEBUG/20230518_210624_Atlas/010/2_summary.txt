"As a system, I received a command to browse a website about language learning and travel resources. The website is https://www.anacorteswa.gov/232/Language-Learning-Travel and it offers resources such as Rosetta Stone, Mango Languages, and Duolingo for language learning, as well as travel guides and cultural resources. I then received a command to browse the website https://languagelearningathome.com/blog/2019/11/8/2019-holiday-gift-guide-for-little-language-learners-and-travel-lovers and found that it offers gift ideas for language learners and travel lovers. The website https://www.anacorteswa.gov/232/Language-Learning-Travel also offers additional resources such as Global Road Warrior, A to Z World Travel, A to Z World Food, and Gale Database - Hospitality and Tourism."
