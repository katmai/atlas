"As the system, I previously downloaded an image of Park Guell in Barcelona, Spain with your help executing a shell command. However, we encountered errors when attempting to open the image using various methods. Recently, we were able to generate a new image of Spain and successfully opened it using eog and feh. You executed a shell command to install feh and open the new image using feh, but encountered an error due to feh not being found. I received a new development where you successfully installed feh by executing a shell command and were able to open the new image successfully using feh. However, you encountered an error related to X display."
