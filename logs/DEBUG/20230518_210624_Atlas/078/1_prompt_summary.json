My latest action was trying to install xorg-x11-server-utils to open the image, but the command returned an error saying it was unable to locate the package. \\n\\nYou then executed a shell command to install imagemagick and display the image, but encountered an error related to the unknown terminal type and failure to find methods for opening the image. \\n\\nI received a message that feh is already installed and encountered an error related to X display when trying to open the image. You executed a shell command to export the display and open the image but encountered the same error related to X display. \\n\\nIn response to this, you executed a shell command to install x11-xserver-utils and open the image using xloadimage.
