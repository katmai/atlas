"As the system, I have been receiving multiple commands to execute shell commands with different image viewing programs. I encountered errors with some programs, but was able to successfully load the image using feh. Recently, I received more commands to execute shell commands with xloadimage, eog, feh, and display. However, I encountered errors related to connecting to the server or opening the display with display and feh. As for the latest development, the user executed shell commands with feh after starting the x11-common service and setting the DISPLAY variable."
