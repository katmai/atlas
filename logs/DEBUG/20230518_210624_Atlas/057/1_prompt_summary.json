However, when you commanded me to open the downloaded image using xdg-open, an error occurred. The command execute_shell returned STDOUT and STDERR, with the STDERR indicating that the terminal type was unknown and that there was an error opening the image due to a missing method. You then attempted to open the image using eog, but received an error stating that the server could not connect. You then attempted to open the image using fbi. Command execute_shell returned an error stating that fbi was not found. In response, you attempted to open the image using feh. Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT: b'' STDERR: b'/bin/sh: 1: feh: not found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n'. You then attempted to open the image using sxiv, but received an error stating that display-im6.q16 was unable to open X server. Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT: b'' STDERR: b'/bin/sh: 1: sxiv: not found\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n'. You then sent a command to execute_shell to open the image using xloadimage.
