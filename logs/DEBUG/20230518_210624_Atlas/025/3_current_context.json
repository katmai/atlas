The website was https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/seven-dos-donts-learning-foreign-language-abroad and the question was \"What are the best ways to learn a language abroad?\". The website provided information on language immersion strategies for traveling. My computer returned an answer gathered from the website which stated that the best ways to learn a language abroad are living with native speakers, watching local TV shows, accepting invitations, keeping a vocabulary book, practicing grammar and verb drills, and consistently speaking the local language. Immersion in the local language is the most effective way to learn a foreign language while living abroad. I then wrote this information to a file named \"best_ways_to_learn_abroad.txt\"."
