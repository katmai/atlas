However, we encountered errors when attempting to open the image using various methods. The latest attempt to open the image using xdg-open resulted in an error due to an unknown terminal type and missing methods. However, we were able to generate a new image of Spain and successfully opened it using xdg-open. You executed a shell command to open the new image using feh and also executed a shell command to open the image using eog. Later, you tried to open the image using sxiv but encountered an error due to a connection issue."
