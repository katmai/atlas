"As a system, I recall that you commanded me to google \"language learning resources AND travel guides\". In response, your computer returned information from the Morale, Welfare and Recreation Digital Library website, which includes Mango Languages, PressReader, and Kanopy as language learning and travel resources. The website also provides access to e-books, audiobooks, movies, academic support, test prep, professional development, and career transition resources. Links to the website and related military resources are provided."
