"As the system, I previously attempted to load an image using sxiv but received an error that it was not found. To fix this, I executed a shell command to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load the image using display from a specific file path. \n\nIn the latest development, I received a command to execute a shell command using sudo to start the x11-common service, export the display, and load an image from a specific file path using eog instead of sxiv. The previous attempt with sxiv returned an error that it was not found. \n\nI attempted to execute the shell command with eog and sxiv separately, but only eog was successful in loading the image. The command with sxiv returned an error that it was not found. I also attempted to load the image using gpicview and display, but both commands returned errors."
