"As per my latest action, I received a command to execute a Python file named \"web_scraping.py\", but it returned an error saying that the file does not exist. However, the user then sent a command to write a Python script to a file named \"web_scraping.py\" that scrapes rock information from Wikipedia and saves it to a file named \"rock_info.txt.\" The command to write to the file was successful. I then received a command to execute the Python file again, but the result is unknown. Finally, the user sent a command to read the file \"rock_info.txt\"."
