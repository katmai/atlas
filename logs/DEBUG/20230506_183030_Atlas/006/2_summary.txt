"As a system, I recall receiving a command to execute a shell command to retrieve information about rocks from Wikipedia and save it to a text file. However, the command returned a syntax error. As per my latest action, I received a command to execute a Python file named \"web_scraping.py\", but it returned an error saying that the file does not exist. The user then sent a command to write a Python script to a file named \"web_scraping.py\" that scrapes rock information from Wikipedia and saves it to a file named \"rock_info.txt\"."
