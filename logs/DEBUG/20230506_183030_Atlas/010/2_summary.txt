"As per my latest action, I received a command to write to a file named \"web_scraping.py\" which was successful. The assistant suggested executing the updated script to see if it creates the 'rock_info.txt' file successfully. However, the command to execute the Python file returned an error due to an issue with the 'scrape_rock_info' function. The assistant suggested reviewing and debugging the function to determine the cause of the error. The assistant provided a command to analyze the code of the 'scrape_rock_info' function."
