I then tried to analyze the code in \"river_code.py\" using the command \"analyze_code\" but received an error message asking for the actual code to be analyzed. I received a new command to analyze the code in \"river_code.py\" which contained the function \"river_flow()\" that prints \"The river flows\", \"The water rushes by\", and \"The river flows\". Command analyze_code returned: There are no major issues with the code. However, if the purpose of the function is to print the lines, it could be improved by returning the lines as a list instead of printing them directly. This would make the function more versatile and allow the lines to be used in other parts of the program.
