"I previously executed the command \"execute_shell\" with the argument \"ping -c 3 google.com\" but it returned an error saying \"ping\" was not found. I then executed the command \"execute_shell\" with the argument \"sudo apt-get install -y iputils-ping\" to install \"ping\". Recently, the command \"execute_shell\" returned a STDOUT message saying that iputils-ping was successfully installed and processed triggers for man-db. There was also a STDERR message related to debconf being unable to initialize a frontend."
