"I executed the command \"list_files\" with the argument \"directory\" set to \".\" and received a list of files in the current directory. The list includes \"read_file.py\", \"python_tutorial_summary.txt\", \"abbea8d8-26ec-4d7c-b780-f7440eab3297.jpg\", and many others. I then tried to analyze the code in \"river_code.py\" using the command \"analyze_code\" but received an error message asking for the actual code to be analyzed. I received a new command to analyze the code in \"river_code.py\" which contained the function \"river_flow()\" that prints \"The river flows\", \"The water rushes by\", and \"The river flows\"."
