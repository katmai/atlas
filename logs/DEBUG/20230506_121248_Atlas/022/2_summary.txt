"I previously executed \"execute_shell\" with the argument \"ping -c 3 google.com\" and installed iputils-ping successfully. I received a successful STDOUT message and an error message related to debconf. Recently, I attempted to clone a repository using the command \"clone_repository\" with the URL \"https://github.com/exampleuser/example-repository.git\" and the clone path \"/home/user/example-repository\".
