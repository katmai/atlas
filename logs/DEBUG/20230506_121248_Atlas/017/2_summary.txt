"I previously appended an image to the poem file using the command \"append_to_file\" and executed the command \"read_file\". The \"read_file\" command returned the poem and image. I then used the command \"write_to_file\" to save the poem and image to a new file named \"saved_river_poem.txt\". The latest development shows that the \"write_to_file\" command successfully saved the file. I then used the command \"delete_file\" to delete the file \"my_river_poem.txt\" and it was successful. I also attempted to clone a repository using the command \"clone_repository\" but it returned an error saying the repository was not found."
