"I attempted to read a file with a specified filename, but received an error message stating that the file does not exist. I also attempted to execute a Python file, but received an error message stating that only .py files are allowed. I then appended text to a file successfully, but when attempting to replace text in the same file using the 'replace_in_file' command, I received a message stating that there were no matches found for the old text. Lastly, I requested the AI to list files in a specific directory again, but received an empty list."
