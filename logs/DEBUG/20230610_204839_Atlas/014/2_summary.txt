"After using the 'analyze_code' command with the argument `<full_code_string>`, my computer requested the actual code string to provide a response. I then received a message from my computer with a 'google' command and a query argument, which returned a list of URLs related to the query. In my latest development, I received a message from my computer with a 'replace_in_file' command and arguments for filename, old text, new text, and occurrence index. However, the command returned an error stating that the specified file directory could not be found. Additionally, I received a message from my computer with a 'browse_website' command and arguments for URL and a search question. However, the command returned an error stating that the URL format was invalid."
