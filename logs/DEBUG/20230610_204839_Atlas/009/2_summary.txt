"I received a message from my assistant suggesting I use the 'google' command to search for the best way to learn Python. I used the command and found a list of websites with tutorials, courses, and beginner tips. I then received a message from my computer asking for the contents of `<full_code_string>` and `<list_of_focus_areas>` to provide a return value for the 'write_tests' command."
