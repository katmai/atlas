"I attempted to use the 'get_hyperlinks' command with a specified URL, but received an error message indicating an invalid URL format. I then tried to execute a Python file using the 'execute_python_file' command, but received an error message stating that only .py files are allowed. Recently, I received a message from the AI to list files in a directory using the 'list_files' command with a specified directory. The command returned an empty list."
