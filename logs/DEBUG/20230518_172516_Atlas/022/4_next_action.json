            "text": "Machu Picchu is an ancient Inca citadel located in the Andes Mountains of Peru. It was built in the 15th century and was abandoned during the Spanish conquest. The site was rediscovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham and has since become a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is known for its impressive architecture, stunning natural surroundings, and the fact that it was built on major fault zones. The site features an urban and agricultural sector, with temples, warehouses, and a residential district. Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti and is believed to have been a religious and political center. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later. Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist destination, visited by thousands of tourists each year."
