It was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America, centered in the Andean Mountains, and known for its monumental architecture, extensive road network, finely-woven textiles, use of knotted strings for record keeping and communication, agricultural innovations, and unique system of exchange based on reciprocity. The empire was organized into a central government with the Inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders. The Inca society was linguistically diverse, with Quechua being the most important language. The Inca religion was polytheistic and centered around the worship of nature deities. The empire was eventually conquered by the Spanish, leading to the downfall of the Inca civilization. \\n \\n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']\"}]\n\"\"\"\n"
