"As the user, I generated an image with a list of top travel destinations mentioned in the text, including Cuba, Hoi An, Chiang Mai, Lanzarote, Vienna, Bucharest, Brussels, and Copenhagen. The image was saved to disk. I requested to browse the website https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions to find out the top attractions in the world. Command browse_website returned the answer gathered from the website: The top attractions in the world, according to Tripadvisor's Travelers' Choice, are Santuario Historico de Machu Picchu in Peru, Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center in Abu Dhabi, St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, and Angkor Wat in Cambodia. I then used the command \"write_to_file\" to save the top attractions to a file named \"top_attractions.txt\"."
