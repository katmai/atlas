It is the most widely spoken pre-Columbian language family of the Americas and had already expanded across wide ranges of the central Andes long before the expansion of the Inca Empire. Quechua is an agglutinating language with a normal sentence order of subject-object-verb. It has seven pronouns and adjectives are always placed before nouns. Quechua lacks gender and number in adjectives and has three vowel phonemes. The language is phonemic and has a set of topic particles. Quechua has a complex system of grammar, including suffixes for adverbs and verbs that indicate subject and object. The language has unique concepts of time and space, with adverbs like qhipa meaning both \"behind\" and \"future\" and ñawpa meaning \"ahead, in front\" and \"past.\" Quechua also has grammatical particles like arí and mana, and a system of evidentiality with three different morphemes that mark varying levels of source information. The language is in danger of disappearing due to the dominance of Spanish and the desire for social mobility among Quechua speakers, but efforts are being made to preserve and promote the language. \n \n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']"
