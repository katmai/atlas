            "text": "The Quechua language is a family of indigenous languages spoken primarily in the Andes region of South America, including Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile. It is the most widely spoken pre-Columbian language family of the Americas, with an estimated 8-10 million speakers as of 2004. Quechua was the main language family of the Inca Empire and is still widely spoken today, being the co-official language of many regions and the second most spoken language family in Peru. The language has been recognized as an official language in Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. The text mentions several dialects of the Quechua language, including Cusco Quechua, North Bolivian Quechua, South Bolivian Quechua, Ecuadorian Kichwa, Southern Quechua (IIC) dialect, Central Quechua, Yaru Quechua, Huanuco Quechua, Ayacucho Quechua, Huallaga Quechua, Northern Kichwa, Northern Peruvian Quechua, Ancash Quechua, and Wanka Quechua.
