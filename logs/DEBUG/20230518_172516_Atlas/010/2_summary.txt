"As a system, I received a command from the user to append a new link to the previously saved language learning resources file using the \"append_to_file\" command. The user added the link \"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/\" to the file. Then, the user used the \"browse_website\" command to search for top things to do in the destination they are interested in on the website \"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/\". Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The text provides destination guides with information on things to see and do, costs, money-saving advice, recommendations on places to stay, suggested restaurants, transportation tips, and safety advice for various types of vacations. The reader can select a country on the map or search for their destination. However, it does not provide specific information on the top things to do in a particular destination."
