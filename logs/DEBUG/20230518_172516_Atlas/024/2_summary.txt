"As the user, I generated an image with a list of top travel destinations including Cuba, Hoi An, Chiang Mai, Lanzarote, Vienna, Bucharest, Brussels, and Copenhagen. I then browsed the website https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions to find out the top attractions in the world, which were Santuario Historico de Machu Picchu in Peru, Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center in Abu Dhabi, St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, and Angkor Wat in Cambodia. I saved the top attractions to a file named \"top_attractions.txt\". Later, I used the command \"read_file\" to retrieve the content of the file and \"google\" to search for Machu Picchu."
