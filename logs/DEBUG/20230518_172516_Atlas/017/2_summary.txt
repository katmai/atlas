"As the user, I successfully used the \"append_to_file\" command to add information about multiple travel destinations to the language resources file. My computer confirmed that the text was appended successfully. I then requested a summary of the information in the files language_resources.txt and travel_destinations.txt using the \"get_text_summary\" command. However, the command returned an error message stating \"Invalid URL format\". To troubleshoot, I used the \"read_file\" command to check the contents of the language_resources.txt file."
