"As the user, I saved language learning resources to a file using the \"write_to_file\" command and then tried to append to the same file, resulting in an error. I then used the \"append_to_file\" command to add more language learning resources and used the \"browse_website\" command to search for top things to do in a destination. I then used the \"google\" command to search for top things to do in a destination and added the results to the language resources file. Finally, I used the \"browse_website\" command to search for top travel destinations and found multiple destinations mentioned in the text."
