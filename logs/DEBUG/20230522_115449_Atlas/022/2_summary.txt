"I received an error message when trying to display the output.png file using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"display output.png\". My computer returned an error message stating it was unable to open X server. I then sent a command to display the output.png file using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"cat output.png | imgcat\". However, my computer returned an error message stating that \"imgcat\" was not found and that \"output.png\" could not be found. I ran a command to download and make imgcat executable using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eddieantonio/imgcat/master/imgcat > imgcat && chmod +x imgcat\". The command executed successfully with no output or error messages. I then sent a command to display the output.png file using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"cat output.png | ./imgcat\"."
