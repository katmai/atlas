"I received an error message when trying to execute the shell command \"feh output.png\". The error message stated that \"feh\" was not found. I then sent a command to my computer to install \"imagemagick\" using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"sudo apt-get install -yq imagemagick\". The execute_shell command returned that imagemagick is already installed. I then sent a command to display the output.png file using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"display output.png\"."
