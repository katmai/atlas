I then performed a Google search for \"Pegasus spyware Mexico\" and found multiple articles from Reuters, the New York Times, and the Guardian. However, when you asked me to browse the Reuters website again to find an article on the topic, it did not mention anything. In the latest development, your computer successfully found an article on the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico on the New York Times website, which reported that the country\\'s top human rights official was targeted with the spyware while looking into abuses by the armed forces.

Despite the country\\'s president promising to stop the practice, Mexico has continued to use the spyware to spy on human rights defenders. Pegasus can infect a phone without any sign of intrusion and extract all data from it, while monitoring everything the user does with it in real time. The tool has been used to fight crime, but has also been deployed illegally by governments to spy on and stifle human rights defenders, journalists, and other citizens who challenge corruption and abuse. The article discusses the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico, particularly by the military since 2019, to target journalists, human rights defenders, and opposition politicians.
