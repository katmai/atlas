"As my assistant, I used the 'google' command to search for more information on the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico and its impact on human rights. The command returned several articles from various sources, including an article from Article 19 about the use of Pegasus spyware to spy on human rights defender Raymundo Ramos in Mexico. I then used the 'get_hyperlinks' command to retrieve the hyperlinks from the Article 19 website and reviewed them to find an article about the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico. However, the command did not provide any useful information, so I will need to find another source."
