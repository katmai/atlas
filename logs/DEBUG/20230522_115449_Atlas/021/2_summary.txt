"I received an error message when trying to display the output.png file using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"display output.png\". My computer returned an error message stating it was unable to open X server. I then sent a command to display the output.png file using the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"cat output.png | imgcat\". However, my computer returned an error message stating that \"imgcat\" was not found and that \"output.png\" could not be found."
