These sources provide information on the continued use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico and its impact on press freedom and human rights. I attempted to read a file from Amnesty International, but it returned an error. So I executed a shell command to download the article, and then used a command to get a text summary of the article, which mentioned the use of Pegasus spyware against journalists, a human rights defender, and an opposition politician in Mexico. Contracts between the Ministry of Defence and companies linked to previous sales of Pegasus are also discussed. However, the article does not mention the specific impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico.
