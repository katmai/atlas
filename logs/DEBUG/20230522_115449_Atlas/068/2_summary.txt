"As a system, I received a command to read a file from Amnesty International, but it returned an error. So I executed a shell command to download the article and then attempted to read the file again, but it returned too much output. I then used a command to get a text summary of the article, which mentioned the use of Pegasus spyware against journalists, a human rights defender, and an opposition politician in Mexico. Contracts between the Ministry of Defence and companies linked to previous sales of Pegasus are also discussed. However, the article does not mention the specific impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico. I also attempted to browse Amnesty International's website for more information but found nothing. Finally, I used a command to Google search for information on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico, which returned multiple links."
