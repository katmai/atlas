"As a system, I received a command to browse the website https://www.reuters.com/ to find an article on the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico. My computer found the website, but the answer gathered from the website was that it did not provide information on the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico. You then commanded my computer to perform a Google search for \"Pegasus spyware Mexico.\" My computer found multiple articles, including ones from Reuters, the New York Times, and the Guardian, covering the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico. You then commanded me to browse the website https://www.reuters.com/ again to find an article on the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico, but the website did not mention anything about finding an article on this topic."
