"As a system, I received a command to browse the website https://www.reuters.com/ to find an article on the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico, but it did not provide any information. I then performed a Google search for \"Pegasus spyware Mexico\" and found multiple articles from Reuters, the New York Times, and the Guardian. However, when you asked me to browse the Reuters website again to find an article on the topic, it did not mention anything. In the latest development, your computer successfully found an article on the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico on the New York Times website, which reported that the country's top human rights official was targeted with the spyware while looking into abuses by the armed forces. You then requested a summary of the article using the command \"get_text_summary\"."
