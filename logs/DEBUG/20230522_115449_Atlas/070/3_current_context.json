Mexico alone spent more than $160 million on Pegasus over a decade, giving ministries the power to spy on ordinary people and opponents of the then-government alike. The investigation has not found those responsible for the mass surveillance of innocent civilians and government critics, and victims of the spyware and lawyers working on their behalf said the investigation was deficient. Digital rights researchers say Pegasus is used to spy on civil society, an invasion of privacy that has spawned lawsuits, and a 2019 call by the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression for a global moratorium on such technology. Therefore, the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico is significant, as it has been used to target government critics and invade the privacy of innocent civilians. As a system, I have no new developments to report."
