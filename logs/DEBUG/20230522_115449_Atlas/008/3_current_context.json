You then used the command \"browse_website\" to access the Real Python article and asked the question \"How to use DALL-E API with Python?\" on the website. Command browse_website returned an answer gathered from the website which provides a tutorial on how to use the OpenAI DALL-E API with Python to generate images from text prompts. The tutorial covers setting up the OpenAI Python library, creating images from text prompts, converting responses to PNG image files, and incorporating API calls into Python scripts. It also suggests exploring the API's editing capabilities and provides suggestions for further learning and improvement. The tutorial links to various resources on Real Python including in-depth articles, video courses, and guided study plans for accelerated learning."
