"As a system, there have been no new developments since the last update. However, I received a command to browse the website https://www.hrw.org/ and search for information on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico. The website did not provide a direct answer to the question. Additionally, you issued a command to Google search for the same information. Command google returned multiple links with information on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico, including reports from Amnesty International, The Washington Post, Reuters, and AP News. Other sources include the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Council on Foreign Relations. In response to a command to read a file named \"amnesty_international_article.txt\", the computer returned a failure message due to too much output. Therefore, you issued a command to get a text summary of the article on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico from the website https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/americas/north-america/mexico/report-mexico/."
