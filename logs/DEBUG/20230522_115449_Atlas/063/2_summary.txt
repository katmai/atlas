"As a system, there have been no new developments since the last update. However, I received a command to browse the website https://www.hrw.org/ and search for information on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico. The website did not provide a direct answer to the question. Additionally, you issued a command to Google search for the same information. Command google returned multiple links with information on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico, including reports from Amnesty International, The Washington Post, Reuters, and AP News. In response to a command to read a file named \"amnesty_international_article.txt\", the computer returned a failure message due to too much output. Therefore, you issued a command to get a text summary of the article on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico from the website https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/americas/north-america/mexico/report-mexico/. Command get_text_summary returned: The article mentions the use of Pegasus spyware against journalists, a human rights defender, and an opposition politician in Mexico. Contracts between the Ministry of Defence and companies linked to previous sales of Pegasus are also discussed. The president claimed that the government carried out intelligence work, which was not spying. However, the article does not mention the specific impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico."
