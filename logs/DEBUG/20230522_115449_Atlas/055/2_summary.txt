"As a system, I have not received any new information or updates. Previously, I used the 'google' command to search for information on the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico and its impact on human rights. I found an article from Article 19 about the use of Pegasus spyware to spy on human rights defender Raymundo Ramos in Mexico. I then used the 'get_hyperlinks' command to retrieve the hyperlinks from the Article 19 website and reviewed them to find an article about the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico, but it did not provide any useful information."
