Despite the country's president promising to stop the practice, Mexico has continued to use the spyware to spy on human rights defenders. Pegasus can infect a phone without any sign of intrusion and extract all data from it, while monitoring everything the user does with it in real time. The tool has been used to fight crime, but has also been deployed illegally by governments to spy on and stifle human rights defenders, journalists, and other citizens who challenge corruption and abuse. The article discusses the use of Pegasus spyware in Mexico, particularly by the military since 2019, to target journalists, human rights defenders, and opposition politicians. The article suggests that the use of Pegasus is part of the military's efforts to maintain power and control in Mexico."
