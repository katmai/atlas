The website did not provide a direct answer to the question. Additionally, you issued a command to Google search for the same information. Command google returned multiple links with information on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico. In response to a command to read a file named \"amnesty_international_article.txt\", the computer returned a failure message due to too much output. Therefore, you issued a command to get a text summary of the article on the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico from the website https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/americas/north-america/mexico/report-mexico/. Command get_text_summary returned: The article mentions the use of Pegasus spyware against journalists, a human rights defender, and an opposition politician in Mexico. Contracts between the Ministry of Defence and companies linked to previous sales of Pegasus are also discussed. The president claimed that the government carried out intelligence work, which was not spying. However, the article does not mention the specific impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico.

Mexico alone spent more than $160 million on Pegasus over a decade, giving ministries the power to spy on ordinary people and opponents of the then-government alike. The investigation has not found those responsible for the mass surveillance of innocent civilians and government critics, and victims of the spyware and lawyers working on their behalf said the investigation was deficient. Digital rights researchers say Pegasus is used to spy on civil society, an invasion of privacy that has spawned lawsuits, and a 2019 call by the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression for a global moratorium on such technology. Therefore, the impact of Pegasus spyware on human rights in Mexico is significant, as it has been used to target government critics and invade the privacy of innocent civilians."
