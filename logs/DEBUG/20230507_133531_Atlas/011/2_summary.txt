"I used the command append_to_file to add the text \"This is some additional text that I am appending to the file.\" to the file \"new_file.txt\" in the \"new_directory\" directory. My computer returned: Text appended successfully. Later, I executed a command to read the file and my computer returned the text \"This is a new file created by Atlas.\" in the \"new_directory\" directory."
