"I executed a command to read the file I just created and my computer returned the text \"This is a new file created by Atlas.\" I then used the command append_to_file to add the text \"This is some additional text that I am appending to the file.\" to the file \"new_file.txt\" in the \"new_directory\" directory. The command returned: File written to successfully."
