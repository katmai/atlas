"I was reminded to browse the website at https://www.commisceo-global.com/resources/country-guides to find information on customs and traditions of different countries by region. The website provides access to over 80 country and culture guides, which offer basic introductions to the language, people, beliefs, etiquette, and business practices of different countries. Loose guidelines can assist in better understanding and avoiding offense. The website does not provide specific customs and traditions by region. Nothing new happened."
