Indigenous cultures are threatened with extinction due to loss of access to lands, territories, and natural resources. Traditional knowledge and resources have been managed by indigenous and local communities since time immemorial. Therefore, it can be inferred that Indigenous Peoples' customs and traditions are an important part of their culture and identity, which are linked to their traditional knowledge, experiences with the natural environment, and their territorial and cultural rights."
