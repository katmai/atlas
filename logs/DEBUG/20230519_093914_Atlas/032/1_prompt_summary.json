In my latest development, I was commanded to use the \"google\" command to find websites that discuss customs and traditions of different countries by region. I then used the \"browse_website\" command with the URL \"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism\" and the same question, but the answer gathered from the website was about medical tourism and health-related topics. I repeated the process with the URL \"https://www.un.org/en/observances/cultural-diversity-day\" and the same question, but the answer gathered from the website was about the importance of cultural diversity for dialogue and development. I then used the \"google\" command again and used the \"browse_website\" command with the URL \"https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-management/foreign-service-institute/\" and the same question, but the answer gathered from the website was about the Foreign Service Institute. Finally, I used the \"google\" command one more time and used the \"browse_website\" command with the URL \"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples/brief/indigenous-peoples-profile\" and the same question, but the answer gathered from the website stated that the question cannot be answered using the text and provided information about the World Bank Group and its efforts to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The text does not provide information about specific customs and traditions of different countries.
