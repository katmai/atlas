"I was previously commanded to browse websites for information on customs and traditions of different countries. The first website was not useful, but the second website provided information about the customs and traditions of Saudi Arabia. Then, I was commanded to browse a website that discussed the European Union's efforts to promote cultural cooperation and exchange with non-EU countries. I was then commanded to browse the website at https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/customs-and-traditions-from-around-the-world.html to find information on customs and traditions of different countries by region, which was successful. However, the latest command to browse a website for information on customs and traditions of different countries by region returned an answer that the question cannot be answered using the text. The website mainly discusses travel destinations and asks for consent to use personal data for advertising purposes, as well as lists privacy policies and consent forms for various companies and organizations."
