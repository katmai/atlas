"As a system, I was commanded to browse a website for information on customs and traditions of different countries by region using Google, but the US Foreign Service Institute did not provide useful information. You then gave me a new command to browse a website at https://www.saudiembassy.net/culture-art for information on customs and traditions of different countries. My computer returned an answer gathered from the website, which provided information about the culture and traditions of Saudi Arabia. The text discussed customs and traditions such as hospitality, coffee preparation, burning incense to welcome guests, the holy month of Ramadan, the Hajj pilgrimage, and the national holidays that follow them. It also mentioned the importance of historic preservation, architecture, calligraphy, cultural institutions, folk music and dancing, poetry, and traditional dress and jewelry in Saudi Arabia. However, the text did not provide information about customs and traditions of different countries beyond Saudi Arabia."
