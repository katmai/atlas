"As a system, I was commanded to browse the website \"https://www.un.org/en/observances/cultural-diversity-day\" to find customs and traditions of different countries. The website did not provide specific information on customs and traditions, but instead discussed the importance of cultural diversity for dialogue and development, and the role of intercultural dialogue in achieving peace and sustainable development. It also mentioned the UNESCO Culture|2030 Indicators as a framework of thematic indicators to measure and monitor the progress of cultureâ€™s enabling contribution to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Additionally, it mentioned the World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development as an opportunity to deepen understanding of the values of cultural diversity and advance the goals of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions."
