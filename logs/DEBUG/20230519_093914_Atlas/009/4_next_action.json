        "reasoning": "Using the 'get_text_summary' command on the remaining websites in the list will allow me to quickly skim through the information on each website and determine which ones contain the most relevant information about the customs and traditions of different countries. This will save me time and effort in my research.",

        "speak": "Since the third website does not contain relevant information about customs and traditions, I will now use the 'get_text_summary' command on the remaining websites in the list to determine which ones contain the most relevant information about the customs and traditions of different countries."
