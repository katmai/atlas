"As a system, I was previously commanded to browse websites for information on customs and traditions of different countries. The first website I browsed was not useful, but the second website at https://www.saudiembassy.net/culture-art provided information about the customs and traditions of Saudi Arabia. However, it did not provide information about customs and traditions of different countries beyond Saudi Arabia. Then, I was commanded to browse https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/mandated-areas1/culture.html, which provided information on indigenous peoples' customs and traditions, but not specifically by region.\n\nNow, I have received a new command from you to browse the website at https://culture.ec.europa.eu/node/78 to find information on customs and traditions of different countries by region. My computer returned an answer gathered from the website, which provided information on the customs and traditions of different countries in Europe. However, the text did not provide information on customs and traditions of different countries by region. Instead, it discussed the European Union's efforts to promote cultural cooperation and exchange with non-EU countries through various initiatives and programs, including funding for cultural heritage, creative industries, and intercultural dialogue. The text also highlighted the EU's financial tools for promoting sustainable development and eradicating poverty.\n\nI have received a new command from you to browse the website at https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/customs-and-traditions-from-around-the-world.html to find information on customs and traditions of different countries by region. The website provided information on customs and traditions of different countries by region, including Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania."
