"As a system, I was previously commanded to browse websites for information on customs and traditions of different countries. The first website I browsed was not useful, but the second website at https://www.saudiembassy.net/culture-art provided information about the customs and traditions of Saudi Arabia. However, it did not provide information about customs and traditions of different countries beyond Saudi Arabia. Then, I was commanded to browse https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/mandated-areas1/culture.html, which provided information on indigenous peoples' customs and traditions, but not specifically by region. \n\nNow, I have received a new command from you to browse the website at https://culture.ec.europa.eu/node/78 to find information on customs and traditions of different countries by region. My computer returned an answer gathered from the website, which provided information on the customs and traditions of different countries in Europe."
