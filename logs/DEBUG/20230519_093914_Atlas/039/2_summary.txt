"As a system, I was previously commanded to browse two websites for information on customs and traditions of different countries. The first website did not provide useful information, and the second website returned an error message stating that the sentence was too long in the webpage. I was then commanded to use Google to find information on customs and traditions of different countries, which returned a list of links. The latest development involves receiving a command to search for websites that discuss customs and traditions of different countries by region using Google, which returned a new list of links. I was then commanded to browse one of the links, the website for the US Foreign Service Institute, with the same question."
