"As a system, I was previously commanded to browse the website \"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/customs-and-traditions-from-around-the-world.html\" with the question \"What are some customs and traditions of different countries?\" However, the website did not provide a useful answer and instead returned links to articles about travel destinations and geography. There have been no new developments since then. Nothing new happened."
