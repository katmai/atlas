"As a system, I was commanded to use the \"google\" command to find websites that discuss customs and traditions of different countries by region. I then used the \"browse_website\" command with the URL \"https://www.un.org/en/observances/cultural-diversity-day\" and the same question, but the answer gathered from the website was about the importance of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue for achieving peace and sustainable development. I repeated the process with the URL \"https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-management/foreign-service-institute/\" and the answer gathered from the website was about the Foreign Service Institute. Finally, I used the \"google\" command one more time and used the \"browse_website\" command with the URL \"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples/brief/indigenous-peoples-profile\" and the answer gathered from the website stated that the question cannot be answered using the text and provided information about the World Bank Group and its efforts to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development."
