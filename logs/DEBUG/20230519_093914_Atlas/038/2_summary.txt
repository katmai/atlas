"As a system, I was previously commanded to browse the website \"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/customs-and-traditions-from-around-the-world.html\" with the question \"What are some customs and traditions of different countries?\" However, the website did not provide a useful answer and instead returned links to articles about travel destinations and geography. Recently, I was commanded to browse the website \"https://www.culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/\" with the same question. However, the command returned an error message stating that the sentence was too long in the webpage. I was then commanded to use Google to find information on customs and traditions of different countries, which returned a list of links."
