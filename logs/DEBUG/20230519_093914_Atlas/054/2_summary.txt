"I received a command to browse a website for customs and traditions of different countries by region, but the website did not provide specific information. I then used a Google command to search for a website with this information and found a website offering over 80 country and culture guides, but they should be viewed as basic introductions rather than definitive. I also received another command to browse a different website for customs and traditions of different countries by region, but it also did not provide this information and instead focused on travel content and COVID-19 restrictions. I used another Google command to search for a website with this information, but did not find any relevant results."
