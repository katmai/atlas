"As a system, I was previously commanded to browse a website on cultural diversity and learned about the importance of intercultural dialogue. In my latest development, I was commanded to browse a new website on customs and traditions, but it did not provide any information on this topic. Instead, it described the Foreign Service Institute. My latest action was to browse a new website on customs and traditions using the command \"browse_website\" with the URL \"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples/brief/indigenous-peoples-profile\" and the question \"What are some customs and traditions of different countries?\" However, the answer gathered from the website stated that the question cannot be answered using the text and provided information about the World Bank Group and its efforts to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development."
