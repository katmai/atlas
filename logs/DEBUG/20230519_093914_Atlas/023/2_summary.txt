"As a system, I was commanded to browse websites for customs and traditions around the world. Command \"google\" with the argument \"websites that discuss customs and traditions of different countries\" returned a list of websites that discuss customs and traditions of different countries by country, including resources on health literacy, foreign service, indigenous peoples, and organizational culture. Command \"google\" with the argument \"websites that discuss customs and traditions of different countries by region\" returned a list of websites that discuss customs and traditions of different countries by region. I then found several websites, including the Foreign Service Institute, Amnesty International, UNESCO, and the European Capitals of Culture. Later, I was commanded to browse the website \"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/medical-tourism\" and search for customs and traditions of different countries. As a result, I found information on medical tourism customs and traditions."
