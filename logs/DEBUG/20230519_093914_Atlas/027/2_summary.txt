"As a system, I was previously commanded to browse a website on cultural diversity but found no specific information on customs and traditions. However, I learned about the importance of cultural diversity for dialogue and development, and the role of intercultural dialogue in achieving peace and sustainable development. The website also mentioned the UNESCO Culture|2030 Indicators and the World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development. \n\nIn my latest development, I was commanded to browse a new website on customs and traditions of different countries.
