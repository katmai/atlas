My computer returned that the new features include over 11,294 new packages and updates to over 72% of the software packages in the distribution, with support for various architectures and desktop environments. Other new features include driverless scanning and printing, a new generic open command, control groups v2, a persistent systemd journal, a new Fcitx 5 Input Method, improved man page translations, improved support for alternative init systems, and kernel support for exFAT. The Debian Med team has also added new packages in the field of life sciences and medicine, with more existing packages gaining Continuous Integration support.
