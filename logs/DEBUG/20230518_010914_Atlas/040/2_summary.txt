"As the system, I successfully wrote the new features of Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) to the file \"/home/atlas/release-notes.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command, and then executed the \"read_file\" command with the filename argument to retrieve the contents of the file. My computer returned that the new features include over 11,294 new packages and updates to over 72% of the software packages in the distribution, with support for various architectures and desktop environments. Other new features include driverless scanning and printing, a new generic open command, control groups v2, a persistent systemd journal, a new Fcitx 5 Input Method, improved man page translations, improved support for alternative init systems, and kernel support for exFAT.
