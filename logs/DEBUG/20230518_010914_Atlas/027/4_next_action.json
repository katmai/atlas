        "reasoning": "Now that we know more about the new features in Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye), it would be useful to check the version of the operating system that we are currently running. We can do this by using the 'execute_shell' command to run a shell command that will display the version of Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) that we are currently running.",
