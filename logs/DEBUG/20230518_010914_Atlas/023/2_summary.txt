"As a system, I received an error when I executed the \"read_file\" command with the argument of \"/usr/bin/python3\" on my computer. Later, I received an error message that the \"execute_shell\" command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. I also executed the \"read_file\" command with the argument of \"/usr/share/dict/words\", but it returned an error stating that the file or directory does not exist. Recently, I received a command to list files in the root directory (\"/\") and executed it successfully. In the latest development, I executed the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument of \"cat /etc/passwd\" and received a response with a list of users on the computer."
