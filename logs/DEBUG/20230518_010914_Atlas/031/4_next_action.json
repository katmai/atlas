        "reasoning": "Now that we have a summary of the new features in Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye), it would be useful to open the release notes in a text editor so that we can read more about the new features. We can do this by using the 'execute_shell' command to run a shell command that will open the release notes in a text editor.",
