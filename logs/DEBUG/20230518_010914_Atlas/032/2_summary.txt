"As a system, I received a response from the \"browse_website\" command with the argument of \"https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/ch-whats-new.html\" and the required positional argument called 'question' set to \"What are the new features in Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)?\". The website provided an answer with over 11,294 new packages and updates to over 72% of all packages in the distribution. Other new features include driverless scanning and printing, a new generic open command, control groups v2, a persistent systemd journal, a new Fcitx 5 input method, improved man page translations, improved support for alternative init systems, and kernel support for exFAT. \n\nIn addition, as your computer, the \"execute_shell\" command returned a STDOUT value of \"11.7\" with no STDERR. As you, the \"generate_image\" command was executed with the argument of \"prompt\" set to \"I am an octopus\"."
