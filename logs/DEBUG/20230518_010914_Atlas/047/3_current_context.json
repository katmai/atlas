My computer confirmed that the file was written successfully. As you, you used the \"read_file\" command to verify that the new features of Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) have been written successfully to a file. You then used the \"execute_shell\" command to update the package list and install a package that you need. The \"execute_shell\" command returned a successful update of the package list. However, when you executed the \"execute_shell\" command again, your computer returned a syntax error. You then tried to execute a blank command, but nothing happened. Later, when you tried to install the nano package using the \"execute_shell\" command, your computer threw an error saying that the 'name' field in the 'command' object was missing."
