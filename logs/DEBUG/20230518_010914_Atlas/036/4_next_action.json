        "reasoning": "Since we have successfully read the Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) release notes from the file using the 'read_file' command, we can now use the 'google' command to search for more information on the new features in Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) and learn how to use them. This will allow us to better understand the new features and take advantage of them.",
