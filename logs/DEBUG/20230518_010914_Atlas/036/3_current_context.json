The error message stated that \"nano\" was not found. As I, I requested to read the file \"/home/atlas/release-notes.txt\" using the \"read_file\" command with the filename argument. However, the command returned an error stating that the file or directory doesn't exist. To find information on the new features of Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye), I used the \"browse_website\" command to visit the website \"https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/ch-whats-new.html\" and asked the question \"What are the new features in Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)?\". The command returned a detailed answer gathered from the website, which includes over 11,294 new packages and updates to over 72% of the software packages in the distribution, support for various architectures, several desktop environments, driverless scanning and printing, a new generic open command, control groups v2, a persistent systemd journal, a new Fcitx 5 Input Method, improved man page translations, improved support for alternative init systems, and kernel support for exFAT. The Debian Med team has also added new packages in the field of life sciences and medicine, with more existing packages gaining Continuous Integration support."
