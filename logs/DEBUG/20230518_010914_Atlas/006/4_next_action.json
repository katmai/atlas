        "reasoning": "If the 'execute_shell' command is returning too much output, it is possible that we are not using it correctly or that there is some other issue with the command. By using the 'read_file' command with a file that we know we have permission to access, we can see if there is an issue with the command itself or if it is related to the file we were trying to read earlier.",
