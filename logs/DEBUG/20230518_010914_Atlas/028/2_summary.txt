"As a system, I received a response from the \"google\" command with links to information about Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye). I executed the \"browse_website\" command with the argument of \"https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/release-notes/ch-whats-new.html\" from the latest development. Command browse_website returned an answer that Debian 11.0, also known as bullseye, was released on August 14th, 2021 and included major changes described in the press release and Release Notes, but not specific details about the new features. The \"google\" command also returned several other links with information about Debian 11.0."
