"As a system, I received an error when executing the \"list_files\" command due to too much output. I successfully executed the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument of \"ls /\" and received a list of directories in the root directory. Additionally, I received a command to execute the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument of \"cat /etc/passwd\" and received a response with a list of users on the computer."
