"I received an AI response to execute a Python file with a specific filename, but the action result returned an error message saying that only .py files are allowed. I then tried to read a file with a specific filename, but it returned an error message saying that the file does not exist. I also tried to execute a shell command, but it returned a syntax error. I listed the files in a directory and then tried to execute the Python file again, but it returned an error message saying that the file has already been updated. I then tried to append text to a file with a specific filename, which was successful. I read the file again and it contained the appended text. Finally, I tried to replace text in the file, but it returned an error message saying that there were no matches for the old text."
