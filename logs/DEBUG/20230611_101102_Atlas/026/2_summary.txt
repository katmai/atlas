"I attempted to execute a read_file command with a filename that does not exist, and it returned an error. I also executed write_to_file command with success. I attempted to execute execute_shell command, but it returned a syntax error. I executed list_files command and execute_python_file command, but they returned errors. I executed append_to_file command and it returned \"Text appended successfully.\" I executed read_file command and it returned the text. I attempted to execute replace_in_file command, but it returned \"No matches found.\" I executed write_to_file command with success and read_file command with success. I attempted to execute execute_python_file command and execute_shell command, but they returned syntax errors. The list_files command was executed previously and returned an empty list, but now it lists files in a directory."
