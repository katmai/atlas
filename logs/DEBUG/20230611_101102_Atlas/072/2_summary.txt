"I attempted to execute the list_files command with the given directory, but it still returned an empty list. When executing the read_file command, it returned an error message stating that the file does not exist. The write_to_file and append_to_file commands returned successful messages, but some returned an error message stating that the file has already been updated. The replace_in_file command still returned \"No matches found for <old_text> in /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/<filename>\". I also attempted to execute the browse_website command with an invalid URL format and received an error message."
