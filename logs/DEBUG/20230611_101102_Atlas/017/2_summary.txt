"I received a message from the AI to execute a shell command, but it returned a syntax error. I also executed other commands such as list_files, execute_python_file, read_file, and write_to_file, but the latter returned an error saying the file has already been updated. When I executed the execute_shell command, it returned a syntax error again."
