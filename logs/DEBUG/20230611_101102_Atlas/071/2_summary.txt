"In the latest development, I received multiple responses for read_file, write_to_file, append_to_file, and replace_in_file commands. The read_file command returned concatenated text, while the write_to_file and append_to_file commands returned successful messages and some returned an error message stating that the file has already been updated. The replace_in_file command still returned \"No matches found for <old_text> in /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/<filename>\". I attempted to execute execute_shell command with the given command line, but it returned a syntax error. I also executed the list_files command with the given directory, which still returned an empty list. Additionally, I received an error message when attempting to execute browse_website with an invalid URL format."
