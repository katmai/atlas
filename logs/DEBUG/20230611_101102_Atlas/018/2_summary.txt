"I received a message to execute a Python file and read a file, but the latter returned an error saying the file doesn't exist. I also wrote to a file successfully, but when I tried to write again, it returned an error saying the file has already been updated. Executing a shell command returned a syntax error again. I listed files, executed a Python file, and read a file successfully. I also tried to append to a file, which was successful."
