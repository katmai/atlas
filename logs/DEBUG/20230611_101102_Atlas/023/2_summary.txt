"I received multiple AI responses including executing Python files, reading, writing, and appending to files, executing shell commands, and replacing text in a file. Some commands returned errors, while others were successful. When attempting to replace text in a file, the command returned no matches found. Overall, I have interacted with multiple files and directories on my computer. Previous action of listing files in a directory returned an empty list."
