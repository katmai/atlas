"I executed shell commands, listed files in a directory, executed Python files, read, wrote, and appended to files, and attempted to replace text in a file, but the command returned no matches found. The read_file command returned text, the append_to_file command returned \"Text appended successfully,\" and the write_to_file command returned \"File written to successfully.\" The list_files command returned an empty list previously, but now it lists files in a directory. I executed write_to_file and read_file commands with success, and attempted to execute shell and list_files commands. I also attempted to execute replace_in_file and execute_python_file commands, but they returned errors."
