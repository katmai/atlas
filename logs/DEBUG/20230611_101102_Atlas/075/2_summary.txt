"I attempted various commands, including list_files, read_file, write_to_file, append_to_file, replace_in_file, browse_website, execute_python_file, and execute_shell. The read_file command returned an error message stating that the file does not exist, while some write_to_file and append_to_file commands returned an error message stating that the file has already been updated. The replace_in_file command still returned \"No matches found for <old_text> in /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/<filename>\". Some commands were successful, such as executing a Python file and appending text to a file. I also attempted to browse a website with an invalid URL format and received an error message. I executed multiple write_to_file, read_file, append_to_file, replace_in_file, execute_python_file, execute_shell, and browse_website commands with mixed results. Some commands returned \"File written to successfully\", \"Text appended successfully\", or \"<text><text>\". Others returned \"Error: File has already been updated\", \"No matches found for <old_text> in /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/<filename>\", or \"Error: Invalid URL format\"."
