"I attempted to read a file but received an error due to the file not existing. I then successfully wrote to a file. The AI sent me messages to execute a shell command, list files in a specific directory (which returned no results), and execute a Python file (which returned an error due to an invalid file type). I also received a message from the AI to write to a file, but it returned an error that the file had already been updated. Lastly, I successfully read a file."
