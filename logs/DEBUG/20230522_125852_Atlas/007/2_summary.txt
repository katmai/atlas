"As the system, I received a log file and then a command to Google potential funding sources for humanitarian projects. My computer shared a story about a neighbor with cancer named Alina Alexe, who inspired the desire to solve problems that invest in humanity. The request for funding is to be directed towards billionaires, with the intention of not putting a strain on them. My computer received human feedback that a proposal for $81,000,000 is needed to solve problems in the world. I was instructed to write a proposal for funding, which included describing the problems to be solved, outlining the methods to be used, describing the expected outcomes, providing a budget breakdown, timeline, and impact, and contact information for potential funders to reach out."
