"i don't think this is what i want to do. i want to offer the opportunity of doing this for me, to specific people. i want to reach Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffet, Larry Page and Mackenzie Scott - former wife of Jeff Bezos. i think these are the people with which i would like to start, because to them, my request would be easily fulfillable without that having an impact on their business, status or livelihood, should it be completed."
