She has this amazing personality and she's always so uplifting and i don't think i have ever met someone else like her. She is great. i wish we spent more time together, i might have learned a thing or two more from her. Earlier this year, i found out she has cancer. i didn't think too much of the news because i know i can't really do anything about it. i don't think so, at least. However, i went home to pick up my mom and bring her here, 3 months ago, and i met Alina. She was unrecognizable physically. i saw her from a little afar, and i had no idea who she was until she started speaking. She deteriorated so much, her fingernails were broken, she was wearing a wig, but once i got close and she started speaking she was still Alina. Still uplifting, still like a bird trilling in spring full of happiness. i don't know how she does it, but i hope she never stops. Now back to me and my funding request. This is the kind of problems i intend to solve. i don't want money to make more money. This is not an investment in the financial sense of the word, but it's an investment in humanity. This is why i am asking to get funding from billionnaires, because i am asking for some resources while trying not to put strain on them in the process. i'm only asking knowing they can easily spare what i ask for."
