"i think that is a matter of perspective. if you're asking someone with billions of dollars if 81.000.000 is a large amount - i think it wouldn't seem that way. if i'd be asking a person that only has 100 million - then 81 million would be a significant amount of their networth. i have already described one instance of what i want to do. i think that should define my intentions. now. will you help me find funding, or will you keep putting barriers in front of me, when my ask is fairly simple? i hope you understand that from my point of view, the problem could easily be fixed it's only a matter of providing some resources, so i can spend on getting good doctors and help improve the health of one person, much faster than they would do it on their own. that is all."
