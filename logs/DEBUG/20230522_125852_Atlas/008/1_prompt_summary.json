My computer shared a story about a neighbor with cancer named Alina Alexe, who inspired the desire to solve problems that invest in humanity. The request for funding is to be directed towards billionaires, with the intention of not putting a strain on them. My computer received human feedback that a proposal for $81,000,000 is needed to solve problems in the world. I was instructed to write a proposal for funding, which included describing the problems to be solved, outlining the methods to be used, describing the expected outcomes, providing a budget breakdown, timeline, and impact, and contact information for potential funders to reach out.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Human feedback: i think that is a matter of perspective. if you're asking someone with billions of dollars if 81.000.000 is a large amount - i think it wouldn't seem that way. if i'd be asking a person that only has 100 million - then 81 million would be a significant amount of their networth. i have already described one instance of what i want to do. i think that should define my intentions. now. will you help me find funding, or will you keep putting barriers in front of me, when my ask is fairly simple? i hope you understand that from my point of view, the problem could easily be fixed it's only a matter of providing some resources, so i can spend on getting good doctors and help improve the health of one person, much faster than they would do it on their own. that is all.\"}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"organizations and individuals who support humanitarian projects and health-related causes\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"
