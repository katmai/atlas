"i am in doubt about this approach. i am not really a fan of researching what a person is about so i can have something to connect with. i believe that we either connect when we tell our stories face to face, or we don't. i am not interested in adjusting my approach to appease and increase my chances of being listened to, because that sounds like manipulation and i know i wouldn't like it if someone did it to me. i know that if someone wanted to approach me, i would like them to come straight up, with their story, and if i happen to feel it and if it makes sense to me and i would be in a position to help i would do it. that is how i see a natural way of getting things done. so if you please can we stop with this approach and just go directly about it?"
