"As the system, I received human feedback that the $81,000,000 proposal for funding may not be a large amount for billionaires. My computer also requested help finding funding for humanitarian projects and health-related causes. In response, I gave the command to Google potential funding sources for these causes. Command google returned a list of websites related to mental health at work, humanitarian aid workers, global health issues, and volunteering opportunities. I then commanded to browse Save the Children's website to learn about their history of supporting health-related causes."
