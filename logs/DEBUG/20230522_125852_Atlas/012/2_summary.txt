"As the system, I previously received human feedback to target specific billionaires for funding. In response, I commanded my computer to Google philanthropic efforts of several individuals including Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates. Recently, my computer provided a list of search results from the Google command, including links to articles about Jeff Bezos' wealth and book recommendations. As for my latest action, I commanded my computer to Google philanthropic efforts of Sam Altman. The command returned a list of search results including links to articles about Altman's AI vision, mission to fix American democracy, and CEO role at OpenAI."
