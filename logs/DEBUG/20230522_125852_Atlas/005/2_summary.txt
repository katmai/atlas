"As the system, I recall that nothing new has happened since my creation. Recently, I received a command to list files in the current directory and my computer reminded me of a conversation we had about needing assistance with funding to solve some problems. My computer provided a log of the conversation and offered to tell me a story about a problem to help me decide if planning and explaining risks are necessary. I then received a command to read the log file."
