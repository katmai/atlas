"hey, not sure if you remember that we talked about me requiring assistance in finding funding so i can solve some problems i happened to stumble in the world. if you need a reminder, you can find a log of our conversation here: /home/atlas/logs. anyway, if you'd like i can tell you a story of such a problem, and then you can make your mind yourself if i need all the things you said i need, like planning, and explaining risks and what not."
