        "text": "It seems like the 'google' command did not return the information we were looking for. Instead, I suggest we use the 'get_hyperlinks' command to get the hyperlinks from the travel website and explore them further.",
        "reasoning": "The 'google' command did not provide us with the information we were looking for. However, we know that the travel website we visited earlier had information about popular travel destinations. The 'get_hyperlinks' command can help us explore the website further and find more information.",
