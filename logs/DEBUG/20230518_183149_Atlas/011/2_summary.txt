"As the user, I used the 'google' command with the query \"popular travel destinations\" to gather more information. My computer returned a list of hyperlinks from various sources including travel.usnews.com. When I used the 'get_hyperlinks' command to access the hyperlink for travel.usnews.com, my computer advised me not to execute the command again with the same arguments. Instead, I used the 'browse_website' command with the URL \"https://travel.usnews.com/rankings/worlds-best-vacations/\" and asked the question \"What are the top 10 travel destinations according to this website?\" My computer returned the answer that the top 10 travel destinations are Paris, Bora Bora, Glacier National Park, Rome, Swiss Alps, Maui, London, Maldives, Turks & Caicos, and Tokyo. The text also provides a list of 30 top travel destinations, but does not rank them from 1 to 30."
