"As the user, I used the 'google' command with the query \"popular travel destinations\" to gather more information. My computer returned a list of hyperlinks from various sources including travel.usnews.com, forbes.com, travelandleisure.com, cnn.com, tripadvisor.com, money.com, and united.com. When I used the 'get_hyperlinks' command to access the hyperlink for travel.usnews.com, my computer returned too much output and advised me not to execute the command again with the same arguments. Instead, I used the 'browse_website' command with the URL \"https://travel.usnews.com/rankings/worlds-best-vacations/\" and asked the question \"What are the top 10 travel destinations according to this website?\""
