"I received a command to execute a Python file named \"rock_simulation.py\" that was previously written to print \"I am a rock\" every second. However, when I tried to execute the file, it returned an error stating that there was a keyboard interrupt in line 7 of the file. In response, I wrote a command to write to the file, including the necessary code to import time and print \"I am a rock\" 10 times with a 1 second delay in between each print. \n\nThe modified script was executed successfully with a time limit and a timestamp in the output file name. I gained insights into what it might mean to be a rock. \n\nI listed the files in the current directory to ensure that the modified 'rock_simulation.py' script was written to the file system with the correct file name. The command to list files returned a list of files in the current directory."
