"I received a command to browse a website and learn something new, but an error occurred when trying to generate embeddings from the model. Then, I received a command to execute a Python file, but encountered an error because the file was not found. Finally, I decided to list the files in the current directory and successfully received a list of files, including the missing Python file."
