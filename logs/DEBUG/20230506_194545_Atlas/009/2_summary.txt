"I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command to run the \"river_simulation.py\" script, but it returned an error with a traceback indicating a keyboard interrupt. Previously, I successfully wrote to a file using the \"write_to_file\" command. I received a command to execute a shell with the \"pgrep -f 'python river_simulation.py'\" command line."
