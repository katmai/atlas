"I attempted to execute a Python file called \"river_simulation.py\" using the \"execute_python_file\" command, but it returned an error message saying it was terminated. I then analyzed the code using the \"analyze_code\" command, which contained a while loop that printed \"I am a river\" every second using the time.sleep() function."
