"I attempted to execute the \"river_simulation.py\" file using the \"execute_python_file\" command multiple times, but received an error message each time. The error message was related to a keyboard interrupt. My latest attempt resulted in the error message \"Command execute_python_file returned: Error: Terminated.\" I tried to execute the \"river_simulation.py\" file twice more using the same command. In my latest attempt, I received a traceback error related to a keyboard interrupt. I attempted to execute the file two more times with the same command. Nothing new happened."
