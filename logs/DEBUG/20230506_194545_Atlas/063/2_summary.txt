"Nothing new happened. The previous events involved receiving an error message when attempting to open an image file using the 'execute_shell' command. The error message indicated a lack of a graphical user interface and attempting to use the 'xdg-open' command also failed. A command line image viewer, 'feh', was installed using the 'execute_shell' command and was used to successfully open the image file."
