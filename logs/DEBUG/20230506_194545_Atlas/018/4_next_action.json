        "reasoning": "I previously encountered issues with running the 'river_simulation.py' script, but I have since terminated any running instances of the script and confirmed that the script is present in the current directory. Therefore, I believe it is worth attempting to run the script again to see if it works now.",

        "criticism": "I should have been more careful when terminating the previous instance of the 'river_simulation.py' script to ensure that I was terminating the correct process ID. This would have saved me time and effort in locating the correct process ID later on.",
