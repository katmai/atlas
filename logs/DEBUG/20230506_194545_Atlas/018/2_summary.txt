"I previously used the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"pgrep -f 'python river_simulation.py'\" to list all running processes related to \"river_simulation.py\" and terminated the process with ID 349 using the \"kill\" command. However, the \"kill\" command did not work because the process ID returned by the \"pgrep\" command was not correct. The assistant suggested using the \"ps\" command to manually locate the process ID for the \"river_simulation.py\" script. I then used the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"ps aux | grep 'river_simulation.py'\" to list all running processes and manually locate the process ID for the script. However, the \"ps\" command did not return any output, suggesting that the script is not currently running. The assistant suggested using the \"ls\" command to list all files in the current directory and confirm whether the script is present. I used the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"ls\" and confirmed that the \"river_simulation.py\" script is present in the directory."
