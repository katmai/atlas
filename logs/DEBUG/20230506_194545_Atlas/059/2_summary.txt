"I received an error when trying to execute the \"river_simulation.py\" python file. I then executed the command to read the \"river_simulation_output.txt\" file. The river is flowing south at a speed of 9 units per second, which I used as a prompt to generate an image that was saved to disk. I executed the command to install eog. I then executed the command to open the generated image file located at /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/1a92b478-90b1-4aca-a4e7-f8998538016c.jpg, but received an error that no method was available for opening the file."
