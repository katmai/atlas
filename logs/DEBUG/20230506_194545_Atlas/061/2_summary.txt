"I received an error message when trying to open the generated image file using the 'execute_shell' command. The error message suggests that I am not running a graphical user interface, so I cannot open the image viewer. I tried to use the 'xdg-open' command to open the image file, but it did not work. The error message suggests that there is no method available for opening the file. I then installed a command line image viewer such as 'feh' using the 'execute_shell' command. I used the installed command line image viewer to open the generated image file."
