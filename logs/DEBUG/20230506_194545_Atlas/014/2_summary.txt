"I previously used the \"execute_shell\" command to run the \"pgrep -f 'python river_simulation.py'\" command and then used the \"kill\" command to terminate the process with ID \"332\". However, the latest development revealed that the script was still running with PID 337. The assistant suggested using the \"execute_shell\" command to kill the process using the PID, but it returned an error message saying that the process was not running. The assistant then suggested using the \"execute_shell\" command to list all running processes and check if the \"river_simulation.py\" script was still running. However, the command did not return any output."
