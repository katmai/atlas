        "text": "I think we should try to find the process ID of the 'river_simulation.py' script and kill it. We can do this by using the 'pgrep -f' command to search for the process ID of the script and then use the 'kill' command to terminate it. I will also add a timestamp to the output file name to distinguish between different runs of the script.",
        "reasoning": "The 'pgrep -f' command can be used to search for a process ID based on the name of the script. This will help us find the process ID of the 'river_simulation.py' script and then we can use the 'kill' command to terminate it. Adding a timestamp to the output file name will make it easier to distinguish between different runs of the script.",

        "criticism": "I should have used the 'pgrep -f' command earlier to find the process ID of the script. This would have saved me time and prevented the script from running for too long.",
