"I used the \"execute_python_file\" command with the argument \"river_simulation.py\" to run the script. However, the command returned an error due to a keyboard interrupt in the script. The error message showed that the error was caused by a keyboard interrupt in line 9 of the script. My latest action was to send the command {\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_python_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"river_simulation.py\"}}}. I have just received a command {\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_python_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"river_simulation.py\"}}}."
