"I executed the 'river_simulation.py' script and successfully used the 'write_to_file' command. Now, I received a command to read the same file, which returned a message stating that the code runs forever and there is an updated version of the script available. The updated version is located at '/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/river_simulation_2023-05-07.py'. I then executed the 'execute_python_file' command with the filename 'river_simulation.py'."
