"I confirmed that eog was already installed on my computer and received a message confirming this. I then executed the command to open the generated image file located at /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/1a92b478-90b1-4aca-a4e7-f8998538016c.jpg using eog. However, I received an error message that the server could not connect and the display could not be opened."
