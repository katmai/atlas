They can be wide or shallow and may flow year-round or seasonally. Rivers have a starting point and an endpoint where water empties into a larger body of water. They may pass through wetlands where plants filter out pollutants. Rivers contain fresh water and distribute important salts and nutrients to support plant and animal life. Humans use rivers for various purposes, which can affect the health of the river and its surrounding ecosystems. \\n \\n Links: [' (https://www.nationalgeographic.org)', 'Education (https://www.nationalgeographic.org/)', 'Donate (https://give.nationalgeographic.org/page/49060/donate/1)', ' (https://www.nationalgeographic.org/search)', ' (https://classroom.google.com/share?url=https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/river/)']\"}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_python_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"river_simulation.py\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"
