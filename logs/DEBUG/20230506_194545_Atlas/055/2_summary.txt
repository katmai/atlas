"I received a command to browse a website about rivers and their workings on Firefox. I successfully executed the command and gathered information from the website. The website covers the different types of rivers, their formation, and their importance to the ecosystem. The command browse_website returned information on the characteristics of rivers, including their starting and endpoints, fresh water content, and importance to plant and animal life. The information also highlights the impact of human use on rivers and their surrounding ecosystems. I was instructed to execute a python file named \"river_simulation.py\". Links to the website are available for further exploration."
