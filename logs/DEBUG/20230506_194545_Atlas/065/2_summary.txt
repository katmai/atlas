"I attempted to execute a Python file called \"river_simulation.py\" using the \"execute_python_file\" command, but it returned an error message saying it was terminated. I then analyzed the code using the \"analyze_code\" command, which contained a while loop that printed \"I am a river\" every second using the time.sleep() function. The \"analyze_code\" command returned a suggestion to add a way to exit the infinite loop. I then used the \"write_to_file\" command to add a try-except block to the code that allows the loop to be exited with a keyboard interrupt."
