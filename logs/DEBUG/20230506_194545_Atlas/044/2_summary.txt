"I read the 'river_simulation.py' file using the 'read_file' command and modified it to include a try-except block that catches both the keyboard interrupt and the system exit exception and exits gracefully in both cases. Additionally, I modified the script to write the output to a file with a timestamp in the filename to make it easier to distinguish between different runs of the script. I used the 'write_to_file' command to write the modified script to a file with a timestamp in the filename and then used the 'execute_python_file' command to run the modified 'river_simulation.py' script and observe the output."
