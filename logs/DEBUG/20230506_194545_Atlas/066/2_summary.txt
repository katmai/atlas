"I used the \"write_to_file\" command to add a try-except block to the \"river_simulation.py\" code to allow the loop to be exited with a keyboard interrupt. The assistant updated the script with a keyboard interrupt and made sure it was executable using the \"chmod\" command. However, when attempting to run the script again, there was a syntax error. The assistant suggested using the \"nano\" text editor to locate and fix the error, which I did. After fixing the error, I made the script executable again and ran it successfully."
