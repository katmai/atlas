"I used the \"execute_shell\" command with the argument \"pgrep -f 'python river_simulation.py'\" to list all running processes related to \"river_simulation.py\". The command returned the process ID for \"river_simulation.py\", which was PID 332. I then used the \"kill\" command to terminate the process with ID 332."
