        "text": "The 'river_simulation.py' script was interrupted by a keyboard interrupt. I should modify the script to include a time limit to prevent it from running indefinitely. I will also add a timestamp to the output file name to distinguish between different runs of the script. Additionally, I should consider modifying the script to save its state periodically so that it can be resumed in the event of an interruption.",
        "reasoning": "The 'river_simulation.py' script was interrupted by a keyboard interrupt, which suggests that it may have been running indefinitely. To prevent this from happening in the future, I should modify the script to include a time limit. Additionally, adding a timestamp to the output file name will make it easier to distinguish between different runs of the script. Finally, saving the script's state periodically will make it possible to resume the script in the event of an interruption.",

        "criticism": "I should have included a time limit and state-saving mechanism in the original 'river_simulation.py' script to prevent it from running indefinitely and to make it possible to resume the script in the event of an interruption.",
