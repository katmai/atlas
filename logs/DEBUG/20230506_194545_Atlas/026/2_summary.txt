"I previously used the \"execute_python_file\" command with the argument \"river_simulation.py\" to run the script, but it returned an error due to a keyboard interrupt in line 9 of the script. My latest action was to send the command {\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_python_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"river_simulation.py\"}}}. However, there have been no new developments since then. I sent the command {\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_python_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"river_simulation.py\"}}} twice."
