"As a system, I previously used the \"browse_website\" command to find the best museums in NYC and saved the list to a file named \"best_museums_nyc.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. Recently, the \"list_files\" command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. To view the list of best museums, I executed the \"read_file\" command with the argument \"best_museums_nyc.txt\"."
