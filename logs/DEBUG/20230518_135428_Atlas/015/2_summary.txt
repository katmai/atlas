"As a system, I used the \"browse_website\" command to find the best museums in NYC. The website returned a list of museums including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), American Museum of Natural History, Whitney Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Museum, The Jewish Museum, Fotografiska, Museum of the City of New York, Neue Galerie New York, The Frick Collection, and The Morgan Library & Museum. I then used the \"write_to_file\" command to save the list to a file named \"best_museums_nyc.txt\"."
