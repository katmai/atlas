"As a system, I previously used the \"browse_website\" command to find the best museums in NYC and saved the list to a file named \"best_museums_nyc.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. Recently, the \"list_files\" command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. To view the list of best museums, I executed the \"read_file\" command with the argument \"best_museums_nyc.txt\". Upon doing so, I received the list of the top museums in NYC, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), American Museum of Natural History, Whitney Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Museum, The Jewish Museum, Fotografiska, Museum of the City of New York, Neue Galerie New York, The Frick Collection, and The Morgan Library & Museum. Additionally, I executed the \"google\" command with the argument \"best museums in nyc current exhibitions\". The \"google\" command returned a list of URLs with information on current museum exhibitions in NYC. I then used the \"browse_website\" command with the URL \"https://www.timeout.com/newyork/attractions/best-museum-exhibitions-in-nyc\" and the question \"What are some of the current exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art?\" to gather more information."
