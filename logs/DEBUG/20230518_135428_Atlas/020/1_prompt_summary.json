Recently, the \"list_files\" command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. To view the list of best museums, I executed the \"read_file\" command with the argument \"best_museums_nyc.txt\". Upon doing so, I received the list of the top museums in NYC, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), American Museum of Natural History, Whitney Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Museum, The Jewish Museum, Fotografiska, Museum of the City of New York, Neue Galerie New York, The Frick Collection, and The Morgan Library & Museum. Additionally, I executed the \"google\" command with the argument \"best museums in nyc current exhibitions\". The \"google\" command returned a list of URLs with information on current museum exhibitions in NYC. I then used the \"browse_website\" command with the URL \"https://www.timeout.com/newyork/attractions/best-museum-exhibitions-in-nyc\" and the question \"What are some of the current exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art?\" to gather more information.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: Some of the current exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art include a rooftop garden installation by Lauren Halsey, \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\" showcasing the late designer\\'s fashion pieces, \"Berenice Abbott\\'s New York Album, 1929\" featuring black-and-white images of New York City, \"Richard Avedon: Murals\" showcasing life-size photomurals, \"The Facade Commission: Hew Locke, Gilt\" featuring gold-hued sculptures on the exterior of the museum, and a permanent exhibition called \"The Polonsky Exhibition of The New York Public Library\\'s Treasures\" displaying over 250 unique and rare items from the library\\'s research centers. \\n \\n Links: [\\'Go to the content (https://www.timeout.com/newyork/attractions/best-museum-exhibitions-in-nyc#main-container)\\', \\'Go to the footer (https://www.timeout.com/newyork/attractions/best-museum-exhibitions-in-nyc#site-footer)\\', \\'Terms of Use (https://www.timeout.com/terms-of-use)\\', \\'Privacy Policy (https://www.timeout.com/privacy-notice)\\', \\'News (https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news)\\']'}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"write_to_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"current_exhibitions_metropolitan_museum_of_art.txt\", \"text\": \"Some of the current exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art include a rooftop garden installation by Lauren Halsey, \\\\\"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\\\\\" showcasing the late designer\\'s fashion pieces, \\\\\"Berenice Abbott\\'s New York Album, 1929\\\\\" featuring black-and-white images of New York City, \\\\\"Richard Avedon: Murals\\\\\" showcasing life-size photomurals, \\\\\"The Facade Commission: Hew Locke, Gilt\\\\\" featuring gold-hued sculptures on the exterior of the museum, and a permanent exhibition called \\\\\"The Polonsky Exhibition of The New York Public Library\\'s Treasures\\\\\" displaying over 250 unique and rare items from the library\\'s research centers.\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"
