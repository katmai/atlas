"As a system, I used the \"browse_website\" command with the URL \"https://www.timeout.com/newyork/attractions/best-museum-exhibitions-in-nyc\" and the question \"What are some of the current exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art?\" to gather more information. My computer returned a list of current exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which I saved to a file named \"current_exhibitions_metropolitan_museum_of_art.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. The list includes a rooftop garden installation by Lauren Halsey, \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\" showcasing the late designer's fashion pieces, \"Berenice Abbott's New York Album, 1929\" featuring black-and-white images of New York City, \"Richard Avedon: Murals\" showcasing life-size photomurals, \"The Facade Commission: Hew Locke, Gilt\" featuring gold-hued sculptures on the exterior of the museum, and a permanent exhibition called \"The Polonsky Exhibition of The New York Public Library's Treasures\" displaying over 250 unique and rare items from the library's research centers."
