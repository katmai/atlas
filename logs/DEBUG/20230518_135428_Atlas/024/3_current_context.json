It was named after Gustave Eiffel, the engineer whose company designed and built the tower. The tower was constructed in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, which was held in Paris to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.\n\nThe tower was initially met with skepticism and criticism from many Parisians, who thought it was an eyesore and would ruin the city's skyline. However, it quickly became a popular attraction and a symbol of France, and it has since become one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world.\n\nThe tower stands at 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, making it the tallest structure in Paris. It held the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world for 41 years until it was surpassed by the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930.\n\nToday, the Eiffel Tower remains one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, with millions of visitors every year. It has also been used for various scientific and cultural purposes, such as radio transmissions, meteorological observations, and as a backdrop for films and television shows."
