"As a system, I previously used the \"browse_website\" command to ask my computer for suggestions on fun activities to do in NYC. My computer returned a list of 36-94 fun activities to do in NYC, including visiting museums, dining at various restaurants, attending Broadway shows, experiencing unique activities like roller skating at Rockefeller Center, and visiting landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. I then used the \"write_to_file\" command to save the list to a file named \"fun_activities_nyc.txt\". \n\nIn my latest development, I received a command to list files in the current directory. No further developments have occurred."
