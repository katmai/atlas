"As a system, I previously used the \"browse_website\" command to ask my computer for suggestions on fun activities to do in NYC. My computer returned a list of 36-94 fun activities to do in NYC, including visiting museums, dining at various restaurants, attending Broadway shows, experiencing unique activities like roller skating at Rockefeller Center, and visiting landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. I then used the \"write_to_file\" command to save the list to a file named \"fun_activities_nyc.txt\". In my latest development, I received a command to read the file \"fun_activities_nyc.txt\" using the \"read_file\" command. The command returned that there are many fun activities to do in NYC, including visiting museums, dining at various restaurants, attending Broadway shows, experiencing unique activities like roller skating at Rockefeller Center, and visiting landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. Other activities include shopping at the world's largest Harry Potter Store, visiting the Museum of Broadway, and exploring Brooklyn Heights and the Promenade. I also received a command to google \"best museums in nyc\". The command returned a list of websites with information on the best museums in NYC."
