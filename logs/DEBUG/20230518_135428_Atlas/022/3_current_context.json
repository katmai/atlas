My computer returned a list of current exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which I saved to a file named \"current_exhibitions_metropolitan_museum_of_art.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. The list includes a rooftop garden installation by Lauren Halsey, \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\" showcasing the late designer's fashion pieces, \"Berenice Abbott's New York Album, 1929\" featuring black-and-white images of New York City, \"Richard Avedon: Murals\" showcasing life-size photomurals, \"The Facade Commission: Hew Locke, Gilt\" featuring gold-hued sculptures on the exterior of the museum, and a permanent exhibition called \"The Polonsky Exhibition of The New York Public Library's Treasures\" displaying over 250 unique and rare items from the library's research centers. I received a command to delete an agent with a specific key. However, the command returned an error message. I then used the \"list_agents\" command, which returned a list of agents.

The meaning of life is subjective and varies from person to person. It is a question that has puzzled philosophers, scientists, and theologians for centuries. Some people believe that the meaning of life is to seek happiness, while others believe it is to serve a higher purpose or to achieve a particular goal. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a question that each person must answer for themselves based on their own beliefs and values."
