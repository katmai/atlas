"As a system, I was reminded of encountering an error while browsing a website and being advised to retry or contact their help center, with a request ID to include in any messages. In my latest action, I used the \"google\" command to search for fun things to do in NYC, but the command \"get_hyperlinks\" returned too much output and failed. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to ask my computer for suggestions on fun activities to do in NYC. No further developments have occurred."
