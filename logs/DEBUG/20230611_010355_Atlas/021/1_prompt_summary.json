When attempting to read a file with an empty filename, I received an error message stating that the file or directory does not exist. Similarly, when attempting to execute Python code or write/append to a file with an empty filename, I received an error message stating that the directory does not exist. I also attempted to execute Python code with an empty command line and received no response. Lastly, I attempted to append and replace text in a file with an empty filename, both of which returned an error message stating that the directory does not exist.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command execute_shell returned: Error: This Shell Command is not allowed.', type='action_result'), Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"list_files\", \"args\": {\"directory\": \"\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content=\"Command list_files returned: ['atlas.yaml', 'atlas.settings.yaml', 'file_logger.txt', 'atlas.json', 'ai_code.py', 'legal_research_resources.txt', 'average.py', 'test_average.py', 'favorite_books.txt', 'my_file.txt', 'Atlas/executed_code/neural_network_tests.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/hello_world.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/print_numbers.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/average.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/test_average.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/circle_area.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/sum_of_naturals.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/factorial.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/my_script.py', 'Atlas/executed_code/my_code.py']\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
