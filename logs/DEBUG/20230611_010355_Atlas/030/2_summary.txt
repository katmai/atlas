"I executed a list_files command with an empty directory argument, which returned a list of files in the directory. I also executed a read_file command, an execute_python_code command, a write_to_file command, and a replace_in_file command with empty filename and text/old_text/new_text arguments, all of which returned an error stating that the directory is a directory. Additionally, I attempted to execute an append_to_file command and a replace_in_file command with empty filename and text/old_text/new_text arguments, both of which returned an error stating that the directory is a directory. Lastly, I executed a list_files command, a read_file command, a write_to_file command, and an execute_shell command with empty directory/filename and text/command_line arguments, all of which returned an error stating that the directory is a directory."
