"I attempted to execute an execute_shell command with an empty command_line argument, which returned an error. I also executed a list_files command with an empty directory argument, which returned a list of files in the directory. Additionally, I attempted to execute a read_file command, an append_to_file command, and a replace_in_file command with empty filename and text/old_text/new_text arguments, all of which returned an error stating that the directory is a directory."
