"I attempted to use the read_file command with an empty filename argument, which returned an error. I then attempted to use the write_to_file and append_to_file commands with empty filename and text arguments, both of which returned an error. I also attempted to use the replace_in_file command with empty filename, old_text, new_text, and occurrence_index arguments, which returned the same error. I used the list_files command with an empty directory argument, which returned a list of files in the directory. I attempted to use the execute_shell and google commands with empty command_line and query arguments, respectively, but both returned errors. Finally, I attempted to use the execute_python_code command with empty code and basename arguments \"my_code\" and \"my_script.py\", both of which returned an error. All of my attempts to use the commands with empty arguments returned the same errors as before. The append_to_file and write_to_file commands also returned an error: [Errno 21] Is a directory."
