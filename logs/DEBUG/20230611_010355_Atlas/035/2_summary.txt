"I attempted to execute write_to_file and append_to_file commands with empty filename and text arguments, both of which returned an error stating that the directory is a directory. I also attempted to execute replace_in_file command with empty filename, old_text, and new_text arguments, which also returned an error stating that the directory is a directory. In addition, I attempted to execute read_file command with empty filename argument, which returned an error stating that the directory is a directory. Lastly, I executed a list_files command again, which returned a list of files in the directory."
