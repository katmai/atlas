"I attempted to execute read_file, write_to_file, append_to_file, and replace_in_file commands with empty filename and text/old_text/new_text arguments, all of which returned errors. I also executed a list_files command which returned a list of files in the directory. Additionally, I attempted to execute execute_shell and google commands with empty arguments, both of which returned errors. Finally, I attempted to execute execute_python_code command with empty code argument and execute_shell command with empty command_line argument, both of which returned errors. All of these commands returned errors due to the fact that the directory is not specified."
