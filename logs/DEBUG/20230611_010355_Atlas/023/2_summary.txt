"I received an error message when attempting to execute a read_file command with an empty filename argument. The error message read \"no such file or directory\". I also attempted to execute several other commands with empty filename or command line arguments, resulting in errors such as \"Is a directory\" and \"This Shell Command is not allowed\". However, I was able to successfully execute a list_files command, which returned a list of files in the directory."
