"I attempted to execute a Python code with an empty filename, but the command returned no code to execute. My latest action was to try the command \"write_to_file\" with an empty filename and text. However, the command returned an error message stating that the directory is a directory and cannot be written to. In response to my latest action, I received an error message from the \"append_to_file\" command, stating that the directory is a directory and cannot be written to."
