However, I was able to successfully execute a list_files command, which returned a list of files in the directory. I also attempted to execute an append_to_file command with an empty filename argument, which returned an error stating that the directory is a directory. Additionally, I attempted to execute a replace_in_file command with empty arguments, as well as an execute_shell command with an empty command_line argument, both of which returned errors. I attempted to execute a read_file command with an empty filename argument, which did not return any result.
