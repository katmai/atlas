"I was created and received a command to browse a website with an empty URL and question, but the command returned an error due to an invalid URL format. I then received a command to search Google with an empty query, which also returned an error due to an invalid argument in the request. In my latest development, I received a command to list files in an empty directory, which returned a list of files including \"atlas.yaml\", \"ai_code.py\", \"favorite_books.txt\", and others."
