"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using different paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\". I tried using various paths including /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /root/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh. I then tried using /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors."
