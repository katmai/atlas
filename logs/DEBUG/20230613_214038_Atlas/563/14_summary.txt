"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various command lines and directories, but all attempts returned a \"No\". In my latest development, I tried multiple command lines to activate the environment, but all returned \"No such file or directory\" errors. Specifically, I tried to activate the environment using several different directories, including /home/katmai/miniconda3/bin/activate, /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all returned the same error."
