"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment multiple times using various command lines and directories, but all resulted in failure. The latest development shows that I tried multiple command lines, but all returned errors related to missing files or directories. I also attempted to check the version of arcgis using python, but all attempts to activate the environment failed."
