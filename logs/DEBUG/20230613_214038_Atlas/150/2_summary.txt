"I executed a shell command to check the value of PYTHONPATH, which returned an empty string. Then, I exported the PYTHONPATH variable with the path to the arcgis module, but the command returned an empty string. Finally, I executed Python code to generate a web map of rivers in the USA using the arcgis module. The code added a feature layer to the map and saved it as \"River Map\"."
