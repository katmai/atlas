"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using different conda paths, but all returned errors stating that the path did not exist. When I tried to activate the environment using the paths /home/katmai/anaconda3/envs/arcgispro-py3/bin/activate and /home/katmai/miniconda3/envs/arcgispro-py3/bin/activate, I received error messages stating that the file or directory did not exist. I attempted to activate the environment using the path /opt/anaconda3/envs/arcgispro-py3/bin/activate, but received the same error message. I also tried to activate the environment using the path /home/katmai/miniconda3/bin/activate, but this returned a \"No such file or directory\" error as well."
