"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in errors indicating missing files or directories. I then attempted to activate the environment using different paths, but encountered the same errors. Recently, I tried multiple combinations of source and conda commands, but all returned the error message \"No such file\". In my latest development, I received multiple error messages indicating missing files or directories when attempting to activate the environment using various paths and commands."
