"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but received error messages indicating that the necessary files were not found. I tried multiple variations of the command, including changing the path and using different conda activation commands, but none were successful. The error message consistently indicated that the conda.sh file was not found. In response to my latest action, I received an error message indicating that the conda.sh file was not found in any of the specified directories. I tried a new command to activate the environment, but received an error message indicating that the specified directory for the activation file did not exist."
