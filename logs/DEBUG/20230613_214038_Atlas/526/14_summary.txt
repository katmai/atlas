"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors. In response to my latest actions, I tried multiple commands to activate the environment using different paths, but still received the same error. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, including using the command \"bash -c 'source /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"'\" which returned the error \"bash: line 1: /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate: No such file or directory\"."
