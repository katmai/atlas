"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths for conda, but all attempts failed and returned errors. The latest development shows that none of the paths for conda activation were successful. Multiple attempts were made to execute the shell command with different paths, but they all returned errors saying that the conda.sh file or the activate script could not be found in the specified directories. The latest attempt was to source the conda.sh file from /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and activate the arcgis environment, but it returned an error saying that the file or directory was not found. Similarly, attempts to source the conda.sh file from other directories such as /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh also returned the same error."
