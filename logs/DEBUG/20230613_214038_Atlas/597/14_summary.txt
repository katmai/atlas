"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths for conda, but all attempts failed and returned errors. The latest development shows that none of the paths for conda activation were successful. Multiple attempts were made to execute the shell command with different paths, but they all returned errors saying that the conda.sh file or the activate script could not be found in the specified directories."
