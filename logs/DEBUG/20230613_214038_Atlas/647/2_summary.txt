"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in an error indicating that the necessary files could not be found. I received multiple error messages when executing shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, indicating that the necessary files could not be found in directories such as /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate. The latest development shows that I attempted to execute shell commands to activate the arcgis environment multiple times, but all returned errors indicating that the necessary files could not be found in directories such as /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate, and /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh."
