"I received an AI response to execute shell commands to check the value of PYTHONPATH, which returned an empty string. I then received an AI response to export the PYTHONPATH variable with the path to the arcgis module. The command to export PYTHONPATH returned an empty string. Finally, I received an AI response to execute Python code to generate a web map of rivers in the USA using the arcgis module. The code added a feature layer to the map and saved it as \"River Map\"."
