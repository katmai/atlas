"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using different paths for conda, but all failed. The latest development shows that I continued to try and activate the environment using various paths for conda, but all returned errors indicating that the specified files or directories could not be found. These attempts included executing shell commands with different paths for conda, all of which returned errors."
