"I attempted various shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all returned errors indicating that necessary files could not be found. The latest attempt to execute the command with a different file path (\"/home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\") also resulted in an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found. The latest development shows that my attempt to execute the same command with the new file path returned an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found."
