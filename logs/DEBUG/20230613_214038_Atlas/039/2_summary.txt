"I received a message to delete a file called \"new_file.txt\" and successfully deleted it. I was asked to search for river restoration techniques and found a website with information on the topic. I wrote a summary of the website's information to a file called \"river_restoration_techniques.txt\" and later created a summary file called \"river_restoration_summary.txt\". I also created a new directory called \"river_data\" using the execute_shell command."
