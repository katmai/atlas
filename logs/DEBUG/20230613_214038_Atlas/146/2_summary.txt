"I received messages to install the \"arcgis\" module using \"pip install arcgis\" but encountered errors. I executed \"pip install -U arcgis\" multiple times and added the path to the module. I connected to ArcGIS Online, created a web map with a feature layer, and saved it as \"River Map\". I executed \"pip list | grep arcgis\" and \"pip show arcgis | grep Location\". I then received messages to execute shell and Python code, which returned empty stdout and stderr."
