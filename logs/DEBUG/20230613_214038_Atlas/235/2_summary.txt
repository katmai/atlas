"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands but encountered errors indicating that the necessary files could not be found. All AI suggested commands failed with the same error message. I made multiple attempts to activate the environment using different commands, but all failed with the same error message. These attempts included using \"source activate arcgis\", \"conda activate arcgis\", and \"/opt/conda/bin/conda activate arcgis\", but all resulted in an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found. I also tried using \"conda init bash && source ~/.bashrc && conda activate arcgis\", but it resulted in an error indicating that conda was not found."
