"I attempted to use \"get_hyperlinks\" on a ScienceDirect page but received an HTTP 403 error. I then used \"google\" to find additional resources on river restoration techniques. After that, I used \"browse_website\" to gather information from the River Restoration Centre website, which provided detailed examples of innovative and best-practice river restoration techniques, including 68 case examples from 39 sites across the UK. Techniques mentioned on the website include restoring meanders to straightened rivers, improving channel morphology, removing or bypassing barriers, and green bank protection. I saved this information to the same file \"river_restoration_techniques.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command and read it back using the \"read_file\" command. When I attempted to use \"get_hyperlinks\" again, I received another HTTP 403 error. I then used the \"write_to_file\" command to save a summary of the information I gathered on river restoration techniques to a new file named \"river_restoration_summary.txt\". The summary discusses the evolution, challenges, and limitations of river restoration techniques in Europe, with a focus on maintaining ecological balance, increasing biodiversity, and improving water quality. The importance of considering natural processes and dynamic flow regimes is emphasized, and successful case studies are presented. The text also suggests a shift towards larger-scale projects and a focus on hyporheic processes, riparian zones, floodplains, and backwaters, and emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches and post-project evaluation and monitoring. The greatest threats to progress are human population growth and climate change."
