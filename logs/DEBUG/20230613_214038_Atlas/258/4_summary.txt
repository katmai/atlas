"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but all returned errors such as \"conda: not found\" or \"source: not found\". I tried multiple commands suggested, including activating the environment. However, none of the commands worked and returned errors such as \"activate: not found\" or \"No such file\"."
