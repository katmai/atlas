"I read \"new_file.txt\" and appended more text to it. I received the message that the \"write_to_file\" command was successful in writing text to \"new_file.txt\". I read \"new_file.txt\" again and it returned \"This is some text that I am writing to the new file.\" I attempted to get hyperlinks from a Wikipedia page using the \"google\" command, which returned several links. I executed \"ls -la\" and received a list of files, including \"new_file.txt\". The \"get_hyperlinks\" command returned too much output and I was instructed not to execute it again with the same arguments."
