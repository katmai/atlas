"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but all returned errors such as \"conda: not found\" or \"source: not found\". I tried multiple commands suggested, including activating the environment. However, all attempts failed and returned errors such as \"/bin/sh: 1: conda: not found\" or \"/bin/sh: 1: source: not found\"."
