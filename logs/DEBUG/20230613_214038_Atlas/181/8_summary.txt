"I received an error message when trying to run a Python code that required the \"arcgis\" module. I attempted to install the module using \"pip install arcgis\" and added the correct path to the system path using \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages\". However, I still received the same error message when running the code."
