"I received a message to check if the \"arcgis\" module is installed by executing a Python code using the \"execute_shell\" command. The command returned a warning that the package is not found. I then received a message to execute the command \"pip install arcgis\" using the \"execute_shell\" command. However, the command returned too much output and I was advised not to execute it again with the same arguments."
