"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in errors. I tried using different conda paths, including /opt/anaconda3, /opt/miniconda3, /home/katmai/miniconda3, /home/katmai/anaconda3, and /opt/anaconda3/envs/arcgispro-py3, but all returned errors stating that the path did not exist. I attempted to activate the environment using the path /home/katmai/anaconda3/envs/arcgispro-py3/bin/activate, but received an error message stating that the file or directory did not exist."
