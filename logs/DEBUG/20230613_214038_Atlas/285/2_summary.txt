"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment with various shell commands, but all returned errors indicating that necessary files could not be found. My latest attempt to execute the command with a different file path (\"/home/atlas/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\") also resulted in an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found. I tried executing the same command with the original file path again, but it still returned an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found."
