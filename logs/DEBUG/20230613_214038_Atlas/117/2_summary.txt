"I used the \"execute_shell_popen\" command to install the \"arcgis\" module by running the command \"pip install arcgis\". The command was executed successfully and the subprocess started with PID: '2786'. Later, the \"execute_shell_popen\" command returned a message saying that the subprocess started with PID:'2883'. However, when I tried to execute the Python code to generate a river map using the \"arcgis\" module, it returned an error due to invalid syntax. The \"execute_shell_popen\" command returned subsequent messages indicating that subprocesses started with PIDs:'2980', '3077', and '3174'. The latest message from the \"execute_shell_popen\" command returned a subprocess with PID:'3271'."
