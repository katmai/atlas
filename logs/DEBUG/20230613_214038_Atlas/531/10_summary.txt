"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory.\" After trying multiple paths, I received the same error message. I attempted to execute a shell command to activate. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the arcgis environment using different paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory.\" Specifically, I tried to activate using paths such as /home/kat/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda/bin/activate, /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate, /home/atlas/anaconda3/bin/activate, /home/atlas/anaconda/bin/activate, and /opt/anaconda/bin/activate, but all of them returned \"No such file or directory.\""
