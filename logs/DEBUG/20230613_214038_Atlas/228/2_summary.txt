"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but encountered errors indicating that the necessary files could not be found. The AI response provided a series of commands to install and activate the necessary files, but each attempt resulted in a failure. The latest attempt involved using the command \". /opt/conda/bin/activate arcgis && echo 'Environment activated.'\" but this also failed with an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found."
