"I attempted multiple shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all failed due to missing files. I then tried three more shell commands, but they also returned errors indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found. However, my latest attempt involved executing two shell commands to activate the environment and check the arcgis version, which were successful. Additionally, I received two AI responses with shell commands to execute and check the arcgis version, both of which were successful."
