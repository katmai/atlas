"I continued to encounter errors while attempting to activate the arcgis environment using shell commands. My latest attempts involved various command line options, including conda init bash and source commands, but all returned errors such as \"conda: not found\" or \"source: not found\". I tried multiple options with no success, including executing shell commands with different paths and activating the base environment before activating arcgis. All attempts returned errors such as \"cannot open /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh: No such file\" or \"source: not found\"."
