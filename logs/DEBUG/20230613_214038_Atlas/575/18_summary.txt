"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various command lines and paths, but all resulted in error messages saying \"No such file or directory\". The latest attempt involved the command \"bash -c 'source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"'\", but it also failed with the same error message."
