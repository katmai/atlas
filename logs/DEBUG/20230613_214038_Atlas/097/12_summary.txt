"I used the \"execute_shell\" command to create a new directory called \"river_data\". I used the \"append_to_file\" command to add additional text to the file \"new_file.txt\" located in the \"new_directory\" directory. I also used the \"replace_in_file\" command to replace the first occurrence of the word \"new\" with \"old\" in the same file. Finally, I used the \"delete_file\" command to delete the file \"new_file.txt\". When I used the \"execute_shell\" command to list the contents of the directory, I saw that the \"river_data\" directory was successfully created."
