"I used the \"execute_python_code\" command to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to search for top kayaking routes in Norway on the Visit Norway website, which provided a list of companies offering tours, activities, and transport services throughout Norway but no specific information on kayaking routes. Using the \"list_files\" command, I found a file called \"norway_kayaking.txt\" which may have relevant information."
