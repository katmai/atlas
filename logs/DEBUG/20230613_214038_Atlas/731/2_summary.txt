"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths and commands, but all returned a \"No such file or directory\" error message. In the latest development, I executed the command \"bash -c 'source /opt/conda/bin/activate && conda activate arcgispro-py3 && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"'\" to activate the environment, but it returned a \"No such file or directory\" error message for the path \"/opt/conda/bin/activate\"."
