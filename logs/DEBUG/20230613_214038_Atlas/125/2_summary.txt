"I received a message to execute the \"execute_shell_popen\" command to install the \"arcgis\" module again, which returned a subprocess with PID: '3567'. I also received a message to execute the python code to generate the river map, which includes adding the path to the 'arcgis' module and connecting to ArcGIS Online. The code adds a feature layer to the map and saves it as a web map with the title \"River Map\" and snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\"."
