"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in errors. In my latest attempt, I tried various paths to activate the environment, including using /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /home/katmai/anaconda3/bin/activate, but both resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors. I also tried using /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate and /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate, but those also resulted in errors."
