"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts returned a \"No such file or directory\" error. The latest development showed multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all returned the same error message. The latest development also includes multiple attempts to activate the environment and check the arcgis version using the command line, but all attempts returned an empty STDOUT and a \"No such file or directory\" error in STDERR."
