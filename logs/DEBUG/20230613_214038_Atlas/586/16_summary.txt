"I attempted multiple command lines to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts failed due to missing files/directories. My latest attempts included sourcing various paths for conda.sh and activating arcgis, but all returned errors. I tried multiple paths for conda.sh, including /opt/anaconda, /opt/anaconda3, /opt/miniconda3, /home/atlas/miniconda. The latest development shows that I continued to try different paths for conda.sh, including /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but both returned errors indicating that the file or directory did not exist. Similarly, I tried sourcing /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /home/atlas/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but both also returned errors indicating that the file or directory did not exist."
