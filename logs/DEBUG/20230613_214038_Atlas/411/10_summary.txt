"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all attempts returned an error message stating that the file or directory could not be found. The latest development shows that I tried multiple paths, including /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error message."
