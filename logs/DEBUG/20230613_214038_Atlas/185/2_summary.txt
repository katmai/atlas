"I attempted to install the \"arcgis\" module using \"pip install -U arcgis\" and added the correct path to the system path using \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages\". However, when attempting to generate a river map using the module, I received a \"No module named 'arcgis'\" error. I tried to add the path to the module using \"sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/arcgis')\" and attempted to generate the river map again, but received the same error. I then tried to add the path to the module using \"sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages')\" and attempted to generate the river map again, but received the same error. I checked if the module was installed using \"pip list | grep arcgis\" but received no output. I then tried to install the module again using \"pip install arcgis\" and attempted to generate the river map, but received the same error. I tried to execute Python code to generate the river map, but received a \"No module named 'arcgis'\" error. I attempted to install the module again using \"pip install arcgis\", but still received the same error. After executing the latest commands, I received errors indicating that the \"arcgis\" module was not found. I attempted to install the module again using \"pip install arcgis\", but still received the same error. I then attempted to install the module using \"conda install -c esri arcgis\", but received an error indicating that \"conda\" was not found. I attempted to install \"conda\" by executing the command \"curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda && rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\", but the command did not execute successfully. I received a message to execute a shell command to install \"conda\" using \"wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda && rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\", but the command did not execute successfully."
