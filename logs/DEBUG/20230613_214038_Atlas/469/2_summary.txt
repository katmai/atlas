"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment with various paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors. I tried to activate the environment using the path \"/home/kat/anaconda3/bin/activate\" with the command \"conda activate arcgis\", but it did not work. The latest development shows that I attempted to activate the environment using the command \"bash -c 'source /home/kat/anaconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"'\" but it also resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error."
