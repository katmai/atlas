"I executed a Python file \"my_script.py\" and received a response. I used the \"google\" command to search for \"how to make a river\" and received several links. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information about the characteristics of rivers from the Wikipedia page. The command returned a comprehensive list of terms related to rivers, as well as information on their morphology, features, and processes. The resulting links included a jump to content, main page, contents, current events, and a random article."
