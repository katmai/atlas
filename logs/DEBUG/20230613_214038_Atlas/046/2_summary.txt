"I used the command \"execute_shell\" to clone a GitHub repository called \"river_data\", but received an error message that the repository was not found. I then used the command \"google\" to search for river restoration techniques and received a list of relevant websites. I used the command \"browse_website\" to gather information on river restoration techniques from https://www.therrc.co.uk/manual-river-restoration-techniques and learned about the River Restoration Centre's Manual of River Restoration Techniques, which includes 68 case examples from 39 sites across the UK. I used the command \"write_to_file\" to create a file named \"river_restoration_summary.txt\" and wrote the information I gathered from the website to it. I used the command \"list_files\" and \"delete_file\" to manage files in the current directory. I used the command \"append_to_file\" to add a line to \"river.txt\". I used the command \"google\" again to search for river restoration techniques and received the same list of websites. I used the command \"get_text_summary\" to retrieve a summary of the River Restoration Centre's Manual of River Restoration Techniques from https://www.therrc.co.uk/manual-river-restoration-techniques. The summary provides guidance for river managers on potential restoration techniques for sustainable river management, including decision support pages for restoring meanders, improving channel morphology, green bank protection, natural flood management, and creating floodplain wetland features. The manual can be searched by river name, restoration aim, or an interactive map, is available for download as PDFs, and is regularly updated."
