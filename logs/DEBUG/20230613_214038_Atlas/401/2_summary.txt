"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using a command provided by the latest development, but it returned an error message indicating that the necessary file or directory was not found. Specifically, the command \"source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\" returned an error message \"No such file or directory\" for the path \"/root/anaconda3/bin/activate\". I attempted to execute the command multiple times, but all attempts failed with the same error message. I also attempted to activate the environment using a different command provided by the latest development, but it also returned an error message indicating that the necessary file or directory was not found. Specifically, the command \"source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\" returned an error message \"No such file or directory\" for the path \"/opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"."
