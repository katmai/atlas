"I attempted to install the \"arcgis\" module using \"pip install -U arcgis\" and added the correct path to the system path using \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages\". However, I encountered a ModuleNotFoundError. I then tried \"pip show arcgis\" and \"pip install arcgis\", but both returned warnings that the package was not found. I attempted to install \"arcgis\" using \"conda install -c esri arcgis\", but received an error that \"conda\" was not found. I then downloaded and installed Miniconda using \"wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda && rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && source $HOME/miniconda/bin/activate && conda install -c esri arcgis\", which successfully installed \"arcgis\". I executed the command \"source $HOME/miniconda/bin/activate && echo 'Environment activated.'\" and received the message \"Environment activated.\""
