"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in errors indicating missing files or directories. In my latest development, I tried multiple commands with different paths, but all returned the same error message. The commands included sourcing conda.sh from various directories and activating the arcgis environment, followed by checking the arcgis version using Python. However, all commands returned the same error message indicating that the specified file or directory could not be found."
