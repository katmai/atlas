I executed a series of commands to add the path to the 'arcgis' module, connect to ArcGIS Online, create a new web map, add a feature layer to the map, and save the web map. An AI sent me a command to execute Python code to generate a river map, which I did successfully. I then checked the Python version and installed 'arcgis' again using 'pip'. The 'pip show arcgis' command returned a warning that the package was not found. I executed 'pip install arcgis' again and received a subprocess with PID: '4893'. The AI sent me a command to generate a river map using Python code, which I executed successfully. I then executed a command to check the system path and received a response.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content=\"Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT:\\nb''\\nSTDERR:\\nb''\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
