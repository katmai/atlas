"I tried various shell commands to activate the arcgis environment but received error messages stating that the file could not be found. I attempted to activate the environment using different paths, but they all failed. I also tried executing the command \"conda activate arcgis && echo 'Environment activated.'\" but received an error message stating that conda was not found. Latest development shows that I tried to execute several shell commands to install and activate the arcgis environment, but they all returned error messages stating that the file could not be found or that conda was not found."
