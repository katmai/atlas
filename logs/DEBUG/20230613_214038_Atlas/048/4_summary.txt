"I used the command \"write_to_file\" to create a file named \"river_restoration_summary.txt\" and wrote a summary of the River Restoration Centre's Manual of River Restoration Techniques. I also used the command \"google\" to search for \"river restoration techniques\" and \"browse_website\" to gather information from the River Restoration Centre's website. I used the command \"read_file\" to read the text from a file named \"river_restoration_techniques.txt\". I then used the command \"append_to_file\" to add a sentence to a file named \"river.txt\". I used the command \"list_files\" to list the files in the current directory and \"delete_file\" to delete a file named \"new_file.txt\". I used the command \"execute_shell\" to create a directory named \"river_data\" and attempted to clone a Github repository, but encountered an error. I used the command \"get_text_summary\" to gather a summary of the text on the River Restoration Centre's website and added it to the \"river_restoration_summary.txt\" file using the \"write_to_file\" command."
