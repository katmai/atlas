"I attempted various paths to activate the arcgis environment and check its version, but all attempts resulted in errors. In my latest attempt, I tried even more paths but received errors for all of them. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the arcgis environment using different paths, but all attempts resulted in errors such as \"No such file or directory\" and \"command not found\"."
