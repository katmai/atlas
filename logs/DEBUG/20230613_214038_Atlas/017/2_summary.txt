"I used the \"google\" command to get hyperlinks from a Wikipedia page, receiving several links. I executed \"ls -la\" and received a list of files, including \"new_file.txt\". I successfully wrote text to \"new_file.txt\" and read it. I attempted to replace the word \"text\" with \"word\" in \"new_file.txt\" but received an error that occurrence index 1 is out of range. I successfully appended more text to \"new_file.txt\". I used the \"list_files\" command and received a list of files in the directory."
