"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using execute_shell with various paths, but all returned \"No\". I received an error message stating that the conda.sh file could not be found in both the /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/ and /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/ directories. I tried a new path /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and got an error message stating that the file could not be found."
