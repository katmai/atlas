The code added a feature layer to the map and saved it as a web map with the title \"River Map\" and snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\". My latest action was to receive a message containing a command to generate a river map using the \"arcgis\" module, connect to ArcGIS Online, create a new web map, add a feature layer to the map, and save the web map with the title \"River Map\" and snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\"."
