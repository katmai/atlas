"I attempted to install the arcgis module using pip, but the command failed due to too much output. I then attempted to install the module multiple times using pip, but each time received an error message stating that there was no module named 'arcgis'. I then executed Python code to add the path to the 'arcgis' module and created a new web map with a feature layer of USA rivers and streams. I attempted to install arcgis again using pip and executed Python code to create a new web map with a feature layer of USA rivers and streams."
