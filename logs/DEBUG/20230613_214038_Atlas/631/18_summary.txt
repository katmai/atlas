"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in an error. Multiple error messages indicated that the conda.sh file could not be found in different directories. I tried multiple shell commands to activate the environment. The latest development includes multiple attempts to execute the shell command, but all of them returned an error message indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found in different directories."
