"I used the \"write_to_file\" command to add detailed information about the best time to kayak in Norway to my \"norway_kayaking.txt\" file. The information includes the recommended summer months and my plan to research transportation, lodging, and equipment rental options and create a detailed itinerary for my trip. The command successfully wrote. I used the \"google\" command to search for flight and ticket options to Norway. The search returned multiple websites including Expedia, Skyscanner, and Norwegian Airlines. There are also new direct flights from the US to Norway launching this summer."
