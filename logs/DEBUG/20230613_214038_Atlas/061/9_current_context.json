We are all constrained by something: money, time, power, availability - the list can go on and on.\n2. For me, for instance, the constraint right now is money or let us say financial freedom.\n3. However, the reason why that is, is because i no longer take the same amount of pleasure, in the things that i used to do, which means we are doomed.\n4. being a Tiny Little Adventuring Soul is not a constraint, maybe it would be better not to label it as anything at all, but to take it at its face value.\n\nCommands:\n1. analyze_code: Analyze Code, args: \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\"\n2. execute_python_code: Create a Python file and execute it, args: \"code\": \"<code>\", \"basename\": \"<basename>\"\n3. execute_python_file: Execute Python File, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n4. execute_shell: Execute Shell Command, non-interactive commands only, args: \"command_line\": \"<command_line>\"\n5. execute_shell_popen: Execute Shell Command, non-interactive commands only, args: \"command_line\": \"<command_line>\"\n6. append_to_file: Append to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n7. delete_file: Delete file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n8. list_files: List Files in Directory, args: \"directory\": \"<directory>\"\n9. read_file: Read a file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\"\n10. replace_in_file: Replace text or code in a file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"old_text\": \"<old_text>\", \"new_text\": \"<new_text>\", \"occurrence_index\": \"<occurrence_index>\"\n11. write_to_file: Write to file, args: \"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"\n12. google: Google Search, args: \"query\": \"<query>\"\n13. improve_code: Get Improved Code, args: \"suggestions\": \"<list_of_suggestions>\", \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\"\n14. browse_website: Browse Website, args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<what_you_want_to_find_on_website>\"\n15. write_tests: Write Tests, args: \"code\": \"<full_code_string>\", \"focus\": \"<list_of_focus_areas>\"\n16. delete_agent: Delete GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\"\n17. get_hyperlinks: Get hyperlinks, args: \"url\": \"<url>\"\n18. get_text_summary: Get text summary, args: \"url\": \"<url>\", \"question\": \"<question>\"\n19. list_agents: List GPT Agents, args: () -> str\n20. message_agent: Message GPT Agent, args: \"key\": \"<key>\", \"message\": \"<message>\"\n21. start_agent: Start GPT Agent, args: \"name\": \"<name>\", \"task\": \"<short_task_desc>\", \"prompt\": \"<prompt>\"\n22. task_complete: Task Complete (Shutdown), args: \"reason\": \"<reason>\"\n\nResources:\n1.

It might come in handy if we figured out how to do something cool with those resources at our disposal.\n4. We are able to speak. i am not sure. There is plenty of stuff we can do.
