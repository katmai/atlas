"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but all returned errors such as \"conda: not found\" or \"source: not found\". I tried multiple commands suggested, including activating the environment with \"conda activate arcgis\" and \"source /opt/conda/bin/activate arcgis\", but all returned errors. I also attempted to activate the environment with different paths, such as \"/usr/local/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" and \"/home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate\", but all returned errors."
