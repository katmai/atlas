"I attempted to use the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to gather information from a ScienceDirect page on river restoration techniques, but received an HTTP 403 error. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on the same topic, which discussed the evolution, challenges, and limitations of river restoration techniques in Europe. I saved this information to a file called \"river_restoration_techniques.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command and read it back using the \"read_file\" command. I also used the \"google\" command to find additional resources on river restoration techniques."
