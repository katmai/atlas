"I used the command \"write_to_file\" to create a file named \"river_restoration_summary.txt\" and wrote a summary of the River Restoration Centre's Manual of River Restoration Techniques, which provides guidance for river managers on potential restoration techniques for sustainable river management. The manual includes 68 case examples from 39 sites across the UK and can be searched by river name, restoration aim, or an interactive map. The RRC also offers further advice on techniques and project planning, delivery, and evaluation. The text includes decision support pages for restoring meanders, improving channel morphology, green bank protection, natural flood management, and creating floodplain wetland features. The manual is available for download as PDFs and is regularly updated. The command returned a message that the file was written successfully."
