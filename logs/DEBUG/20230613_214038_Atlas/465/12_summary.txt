"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all failed with \"No such file or directory\". I tried various commands with different paths, but none worked. The latest development shows that I received multiple error messages from the execute_shell command, all indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found in various directories. I attempted to activate the arcgis environment with different paths, including /opt/conda, /home/katmai/anaconda3, /opt/anaconda3, /opt/miniconda3, and /root/anaconda3, but none of them worked."
