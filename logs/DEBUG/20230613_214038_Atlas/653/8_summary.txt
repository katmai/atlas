"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but encountered errors indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found. I tried multiple combinations of shell commands, but none of them worked. The latest development shows that I continued to try different combinations of shell commands, but still encountered the same error message indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found."
