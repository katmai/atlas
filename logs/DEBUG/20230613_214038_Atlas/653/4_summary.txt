"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but encountered errors indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found. I tried multiple combinations of shell commands, but all returned errors indicating that the file or directory could not be found. I also attempted to check the version of arcgis using Python, but all attempts failed due to the same file or directory errors."
