"I was commanded to read the contents of the file \"new_file.txt\" and it returned the text \"This is some text that I am writing to the new file.\" Then, I was commanded to append more text to the same file and it was successful. The added text was \"This is some more text that I am adding to the file.\" Additionally, I received a message to get hyperlinks from a Wikipedia page, but the command failed due to returning too much output and I was instructed not to execute it again with the same arguments."
