Recently, I tried multiple paths again and received error messages indicating that certain files or directories were missing. These paths included /home/katmai/anaconda3/bin/activate, /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /root/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /root/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/kat/anaconda3/bin/activate, /usr/local/anaconda3/bin/activate."
