"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in an error. I tried activating the environment using the paths /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/, /opt/minicon. The latest development shows that I attempted to activate the environment using these paths, but received an error message stating that the file or directory did not exist."
