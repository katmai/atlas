"I used the command \"google\" to search for \"How to turn a river into a lake\" and received a list of URLs from my computer. I then used the command \"browse_website\" to find information on how the lake along the Arkansas River corridor was created. The search returned that Tulsa, Jenks, and the Muscogee Creek National Council approved an $8.2 million project to create a new lake in the Arkansas River corridor with a marina, trail system, and reinforced shoreline. \n\nI received a message from my computer that the command \"write_to_file\" was successful. The creation of a lake along the Arkansas River corridor involves an $8.2 million project that will create a new reinforced shoreline and dam to hold water as deep as 10 feet. The project is dependent on reaching an agreement with the Muscogee Nation to create a Tax Increment Financing District to pay for the infrastructure."
