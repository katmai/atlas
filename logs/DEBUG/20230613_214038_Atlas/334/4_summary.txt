"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but each attempt resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error. I then tried to activate the environment using the command \"bash -c 'source /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && echo \\\"Environment activated.\\\"'\", but it returned a similar error message. I also tried using the command \"bash -c 'source /opt/conda/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && echo \\\"Environment activated.\\\"'\", but it also failed. Finally, I attempted to activate the environment using the command \"bash -c 'source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate arcgis && echo \\\"Environment activated.\\\"'\", which was successful."
