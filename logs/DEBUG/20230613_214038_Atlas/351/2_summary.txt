"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts returned an error message stating that the conda.sh file was not found. The latest development provided multiple attempts to activate the environment, but all resulted in the same error message. Additionally, I tried activating the environment using paths for both anaconda3 and miniconda3, but both returned the same error message. I also attempted to check the version of arcgis using both anaconda3 and miniconda3 paths, but both returned the same error message stating that the conda.sh file could not be found. The latest development involved executing a shell command to activate the arcgis environment, but it returned an error message stating that the /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate path could not be found."
