"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in an error indicating that the conda.sh file was not found. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the arcgis environment using different paths, but all resulted in the same error message indicating that the conda.sh file was not found. I tried using the path \"/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" suggested in the latest development, but it also resulted in the same error."
