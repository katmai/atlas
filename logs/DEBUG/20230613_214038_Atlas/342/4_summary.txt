"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts resulted in the same error message stating that the specified paths do not exist on my computer. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all resulted in the same error message stating that the specified paths do not exist on my computer. Specifically, I tried to execute the shell command with two different paths, but both returned an error message stating that the specified file or directory does not exist on my computer."
