"I attempted to install the \"arcgis\" module using \"pip install -U arcgis\" and added the correct path to the system path using \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages\". However, I received a \"No module named 'arcgis'\" error when generating a river map. I tried adding the path to the module using \"sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/arcgis')\" and \"sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages')\", but still received the same error. I checked if the module was installed using \"pip list | grep arcgis\" but received no output. I then tried to install the module again using \"pip install arcgis\" and \"conda install -c esri arcgis\", but both attempts failed. I executed a shell command to install \"conda\" using \"wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda && rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && source $HOME/miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\". I then executed a shell command to install \"arcgis\" using \"conda install -c esri arcgis\". However, the execution of the command returned too much output and failed."
