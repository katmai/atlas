"I attempted multiple paths to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error. I tried sourcing the conda.sh file and various other paths, but none worked. Most recently, I tried activating the environment using the command. I attempted several more commands to activate the environment, but all returned errors stating that the file or directory could not be found."
