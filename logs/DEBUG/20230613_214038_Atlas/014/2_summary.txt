"I read the contents of \"new_file.txt\" and appended more text to it. I attempted to get hyperlinks from a Wikipedia page using the \"google\" command, but it returned too much output. I was instructed not to execute it again with the same arguments. Later, I executed the \"ls -la\" command and received a list of files, including \"new_file.txt\". I then received a message that the \"write_to_file\" command was successful in writing text to \"new_file.txt\"."
