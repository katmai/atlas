"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various conda paths, but all resulted in failure. Latest development shows that I tried multiple commands with different paths, but all of them returned \"No such file or directory\" errors. Specifically, I tried commands with paths including /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/kat/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all returned the same error."
