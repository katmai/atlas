"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands but received \"No such file or directory\". The AI responded with multiple attempts to execute shell commands, but all returned the same error message of \"No such file or directory\". My latest action was to execute the shell command \"execute_shell\", which returned an error message stating that \"/opt/anaconda3/bin/activate\" could not be found."
