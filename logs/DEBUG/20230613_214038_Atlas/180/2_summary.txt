"I received an error message when trying to run a Python code that required the \"arcgis\" module. I executed multiple commands to install and update the \"arcgis\". I then executed shell commands to show and export the system path, and added the correct path to the \"arcgis\" module to the system path. I received a message that the \"execute_shell\" command returned too much output and not to execute it again. Finally, I successfully executed a Python code to create a new web map and add a feature layer to it."
