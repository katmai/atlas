"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory.\" Despite multiple attempts using the execute_shell command, the issue persisted. I tried using different conda paths, but still received the same error message. I also attempted to check the version of arcgis using the execute_shell command, but it returned an error due to the environment not being activated."
