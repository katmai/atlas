"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands but encountered errors indicating that the necessary files could not be found. All AI suggested commands failed with the same error message. The latest development shows that I tried to execute shell commands with different paths, but all of them failed with error messages indicating that the necessary files could not be found. Additionally, I received two messages from the AI with the same command to execute a shell command to activate the arcgis environment, but both attempts failed with the same error message."
