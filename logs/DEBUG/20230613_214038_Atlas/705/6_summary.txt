"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in errors. The latest development includes multiple attempts to execute the shell command with different paths, but all resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error. The attempted paths include /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate, and /home/katmai/miniconda3/bin/activate. All attempts returned a \"No such file or directory\" error."
