"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands but encountered errors indicating that the necessary files could not be found. All AI suggested commands failed with the same error message. I received multiple messages from the AI. The latest development shows that I tried to execute shell commands with different paths, but all of them failed with error messages indicating that the necessary files could not be found."
