"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but each attempt resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error message. The latest development involved attempting to activate the environment using multiple paths, including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /home/atlas/anaconda3/bin/activate, but each attempt resulted in the same error message. I received a series of error messages for each attempted activation command, indicating that the specified files or directories were not found."
