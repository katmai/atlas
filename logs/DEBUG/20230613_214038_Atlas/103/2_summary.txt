"I received an error while using the \"execute_python_code\" command due to a missing module named \"arcpy\". I used the \"google\" command to search for a solution and found a website on \"https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/make-a-river-map/\". I used the \"browse_website\" command to visit the website and used the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to get all the hyperlinks from the same website. I then used the \"execute_shell\" command to install the missing module by running the command \"pip install arcgis\"."
