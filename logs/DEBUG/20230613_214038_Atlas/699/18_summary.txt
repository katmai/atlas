"I attempted various shell commands with different paths to activate the arcgis environment, but was unsuccessful. I received multiple \"No such file or directory\" errors for different paths. I tried various paths including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but none of them worked."
