"I attempted to install the \"arcgis\" module using \"pip install -U arcgis\" and added the correct path to the system path using \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages\". However, I encountered a \"ModuleNotFoundError\" when trying to run a Python code that imports \"arcgis\". I tried running \"pip install arcgis\" multiple times, but it returned too much output and did not work. I then tried running \"pip install arcgis\" using \"execute_shell_popen\" and received a subprocess with PID '4391'. However, I still encountered the \"ModuleNotFoundError\" when trying to run the Python code."
