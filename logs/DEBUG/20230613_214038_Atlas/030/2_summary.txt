"I used the \"write_to_file\" command to create a file named \"river_restoration_techniques.txt\" and wrote a summary of river restoration techniques in Europe. The summary discusses the importance of maintaining ecological balance, increasing biodiversity, and improving water quality through natural processes and dynamic flow regimes. It also suggests larger-scale projects and interdisciplinary approaches, with a focus on hyporheic processes, riparian zones, floodplains, and backwaters. The need for post-project evaluation and monitoring is emphasized. The greatest threats to progress are human population growth and climate change.

I used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information from the page, which discusses the evolution, challenges, and limitations of river restoration techniques in Europe. The importance of considering natural processes and dynamic flow regimes is emphasized, and successful case studies are presented. The text also suggests a shift towards larger-scale projects and a focus on hyporheic processes, riparian zones, floodplains, and backwaters, and emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches and post-project evaluation and monitoring.
