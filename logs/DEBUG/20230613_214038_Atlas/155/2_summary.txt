"I checked for the 'arcgis' module using pip list and found no output. I then ran pip install arcgis and added the path to the module using Python code. I created a new web map with a feature layer of USA rivers and streams using the same Python code. Recently, I ran the command \"pip list | grep arcgis\" and received a message that a new release of pip is available. I then ran the command \"pip install --upgrade pip\" to update pip. Finally, I ran the same Python code to create a new web map with a feature layer of USA rivers and streams."
