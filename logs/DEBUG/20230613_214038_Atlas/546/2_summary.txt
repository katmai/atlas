"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using multiple shell commands, but all attempts failed due to missing files. In the latest development, I tried three more shell commands to activate the environment, but they all returned errors indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found. Specifically, I tried executing shell commands to activate the environment using paths to the conda.sh file and the activate file in the bin directory, but both returned errors that the files could not be found. My latest attempt involved executing two shell commands to activate the environment and check the arcgis version, which were successful. Additionally, I received two AI responses with shell commands to execute and check the arcgis version, both of which were successful."
