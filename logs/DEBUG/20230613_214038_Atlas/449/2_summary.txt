"I attempted to activate conda and run a Python script using different paths, but all returned error messages indicating that the necessary files were not found. In my latest development, I tried multiple paths to activate conda and run the script, but all returned error messages indicating that the necessary files were not found. Specifically, I tried to activate conda using paths such as /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/anaconda3/bin/activate, /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/conda/bin/activate, but all returned errors stating that the necessary files were not found. I received an AI response to execute_shell with the command to source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and activate arcgis, but the action_result returned a \"No such file or directory\" error. The same error occurred when I tried to activate conda using the paths ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/anaconda3/bin/activate, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/katmai/anaconda3/bin/activate. Finally, I received an AI response to execute_shell with the command to source /opt/conda/bin/activate and activate arcgis, but the action_result returned a \"No such file or directory\" error."
