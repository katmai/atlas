"I attempted to use different paths with the execute_shell command, but received error messages indicating that the necessary conda.sh file could not be found. The latest attempt involved using the path /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh. However, further attempts using different paths (/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh) also resulted in error messages indicating that the necessary conda.sh file could not be found."
