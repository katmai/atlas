"I attempted to install the 'arcgis' module using pip install arcgis, but the first attempt failed due to too much output. I then tried again using pip install arcgis with the execute_shell_popen command, which returned a subprocess PID of 4391. I received a message to execute Python code to generate a river map using the 'arcgis' module. I added the path to the 'arcgis' module and imported necessary libraries. I connected to ArcGIS Online and created a new web map. I added a feature layer to the map and saved it with the title \"River Map\" and a snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\"."
