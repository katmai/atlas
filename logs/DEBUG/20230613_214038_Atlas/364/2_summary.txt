"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts resulted in an error message saying that the file or directory could not be found. I then tried multiple other paths, but still received the same error message. The latest development involved executing shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts returned an error message stating that the file or directory could not be found. Multiple paths were tried, including /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate and /home/atlas/anaconda3/bin/activate, but all returned the same error message."
