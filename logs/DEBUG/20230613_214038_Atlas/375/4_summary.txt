"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts returned an error. The latest development shows that the command execute_shell was used multiple times with different paths, but all returned a \"No such file or directory\" error. Additionally, the command was used to check the version of arcgis, but also returned the same error."
