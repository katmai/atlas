"I received a message to execute Python code to generate a river map using the 'arcgis' module. The code added the correct path to the 'arcgis' module to the system path, connected to ArcGIS Online, created a new web map, added a feature layer to the map, and saved it with the title \"River Map\" and a snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\". Command execute_shell_popen returned: Subprocess started with PID:'4688'. I received a message to execute the command \"pip show arcgis\" which returned a subprocess with PID:'4785'."
