"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths for conda, but all attempts failed due to missing conda.sh files. I received multiple error messages indicating that the files were missing in different directories. Most recently, I tried to activate the environment using the command \"source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\", but it returned an error message saying that the file /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh could not be found."
