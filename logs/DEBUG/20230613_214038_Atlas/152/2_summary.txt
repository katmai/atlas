"I checked the value of PYTHONPATH using a shell command, which returned an empty string. I exported the PYTHONPATH variable with the path to the arcgis module, but the command still returned an empty string. I generated a web map of rivers in the USA using the arcgis module, which added a feature layer to the map and saved it as \"River Map\". I checked the value of PYTHONPATH again using a shell command, which still returned an empty string. I attempted to install the arcgis module using pip, but the command failed due to too much output."
