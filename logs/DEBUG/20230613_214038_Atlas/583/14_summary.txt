"I attempted multiple command lines to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts failed due to missing files. I tried various paths including /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/kat/anaconda3/etc/profile.d. I also tried to activate the environment using the command \"source /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\", but received an error message indicating that the file or directory could not be found. I tried multiple variations of this command, including changing the path to /home/atlas/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all attempts failed."
