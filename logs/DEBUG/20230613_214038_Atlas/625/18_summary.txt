"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in an error. The latest development shows that multiple attempts were made to activate the environment using different paths, but none were successful due to the \"No such file or directory\" error. Specifically, I tried activating the environment using paths for both miniconda3 and anaconda3, but both returned the same error. I also attempted to activate the environment using paths for conda.sh in both opt/miniconda3 and opt/anaconda3, but those paths also resulted in the same error."
