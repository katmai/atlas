"I attempted multiple shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all failed due to missing files. However, my latest attempt involved executing two shell commands to activate the environment and check the arcgis version, which were successful. Additionally, I received two AI responses with shell commands to execute and check the arcgis version, both of which were successful. My latest actions involved executing the shell commands provided by the AI responses to check the arcgis version."
