"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in errors indicating that the necessary files were not found. The latest development involved attempting to activate the environment using different paths including /opt/anaconda3, /opt/conda, /home/katmai/anaconda3, /home/katmai/miniconda3, and /opt/miniconda3. However, all attempts returned error messages indicating that the necessary files could not be found."
