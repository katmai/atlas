"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts failed. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all returned errors saying that the specified directory or file could not be found. Specifically, I tried to execute the command \"source /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\" multiple times, but received errors saying that the specified directory or file could not be found."
