"I used the \"read_file\" command to retrieve the top 10 kayaking routes in Norway recommended by Eirik Ver√•s Larsen from the file \"top_kayaking_routes.txt\". The routes are listed in the following order: Lofoten Islands, Helgeland, Geirangerfjord, Jotunheimen, Aurlandsfjord, Rondane National Park, Sognefjord, Voss, Hardangerfjord, and Telemark Canal. I also received safety tips for kayaking and a link to visitnorway.com for more information. I used the \"google\" command to search for the best kayaking routes in Sweden and received a list of websites."
