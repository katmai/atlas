"I used the command \"get_hyperlinks\" to gather information on river restoration techniques from a website, but received an HTTP 403 error. I then used the command \"browse_website\" to gather information on river restoration techniques from another website, and saved a summary of the information to a file called \"river_restoration_summary.txt\". I also wrote the same information to a file called \"river_restoration_techniques.txt\". I deleted a file called \"new_file.txt\" and created a new directory called \"river_data\" using the command \"execute_shell\". I appended the text \"\\\\nI want to explore rivers in South America.\" to a file called \"river.txt\". I used the command \"google\" to search for information on river restoration techniques and received a list of relevant websites. I listed the contents of the \"river_data\" directory and found it to be empty. I attempted to download a file from a website using the command \"execute_shell\", but received a 404 Not Found error."
