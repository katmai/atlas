"I used the \"browse_website\" command to search for top kayaking routes in Norway on the Visit Norway website, but it did not provide any specific information. The website did offer a list of companies offering tours, activities, and transport services throughout Norway. I then used the \"list_files\" command to see the files in the current directory and found a file called \"norway_kayaking.txt\" which may have relevant information."
