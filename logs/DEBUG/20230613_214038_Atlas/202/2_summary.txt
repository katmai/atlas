"I attempted to activate the environment using the command \". /root/miniconda3/bin/activate && conda activate && echo 'Environment activated.'\" but received an error message stating that the source command could not be found. The command returned STDOUT: b'' and STDERR: b'/bin/sh: 1: .: cannot open /root/miniconda3/bin/activate: No such file\\n'. I tried alternative commands with paths to conda.sh and bin/activate, but both returned the same error message. I received a response from the AI to execute a shell command with a path to conda/bin/activate, but it returned the same error message stating that the file could not be found."
