"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various command lines and paths, but all attempts returned errors indicating that the necessary files were not found. My latest attempt involved using the command line \"bash -c 'source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"'\" but it still returned an error message indicating that the necessary file was not found."
