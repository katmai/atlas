"I attempted to use \"get_hyperlinks\" on a ScienceDirect page but received an HTTP 403 error. I then used \"google\" to find additional resources on river restoration techniques. After that, I used \"browse_website\" to gather information from the River Restoration Centre website, which provided detailed examples of innovative and best-practice river restoration techniques, including 68 case examples from 39 sites across the UK. Techniques mentioned on the website include restoring meanders to straightened rivers, improving channel morphology, removing or bypassing barriers, and green bank protection. I saved this information to the same file \"river_restoration_techniques.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command and read it back using the \"read_file\" command. When I attempted to use \"get_hyperlinks\" again, I received another HTTP 403 error."
