I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on the same topic, which discussed the evolution, challenges, and limitations of river restoration techniques in Europe. I saved this information to a file called \"river_restoration_techniques.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command and read it back using the \"read_file\" command. I also used the \"google\" command to find additional resources on river restoration techniques. Upon attempting to use \"get_hyperlinks\" again, I received another HTTP 403 error. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information from the River Restoration Centre website, which provided detailed examples of innovative and best-practice river restoration techniques, including 68 case examples from 39 sites across the UK. Techniques mentioned on the website include restoring meanders to straightened rivers, improving channel morphology, removing or bypassing barriers, and green bank protection.
