"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts failed. The latest development involved multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all returned errors indicating that the necessary files or directories were not found. Specifically, I tried to activate the environment using various paths, including those for /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate, /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all attempts failed with the error message \"No such file or directory\". I attempted to activate the environment using a new command provided by the latest development, but it returned an error indicating that the necessary file or directory was not found. Specifically, the command \"source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\" returned an error message \"No such file or directory\" for the path \"/root/anaconda3/bin/activate\"."
