"I attempted various shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all returned errors indicating that necessary files could not be found. The latest development shows that all attempts to activate the environment using the command \"bash -c 'source /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate arcgis && echo \\\"Environment activated.\\\"'\" returned an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found. This command was attempted multiple times, but all attempts resulted in the same error. The latest attempt to execute the same command also returned an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found."
