"I attempted various commands to activate the arcgis environment and check its version, but all attempts returned empty STDOUT. My latest action was to execute the command \"execute_shell\" with various arguments to activate the arcgis environment and check its version. The latest development shows that the command returned an error message indicating that the directory for the activation file could not be found. I then attempted to execute the command with different directories, but all attempts returned the same error message."
