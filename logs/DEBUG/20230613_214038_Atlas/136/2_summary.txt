"I received a message to execute a shell command to install the \"arcgis\" module. The command was executed and returned a subprocess with PID 3877. I then successfully executed a Python code to generate a river map using the \"arcgis\" module. The web map was saved with the title \"River Map\" and snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\", and included a feature layer from a URL."
