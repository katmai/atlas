"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in an error. Multiple attempts were made to activate the environment using different paths, but all returned an error indicating that the necessary files or directories were not found. The latest development involved executing shell commands to activate the environment, but all returned errors indicating that the necessary files or directories were not found. The paths used included /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/atlas/anaconda3/bin/activate, /usr/local/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh."
