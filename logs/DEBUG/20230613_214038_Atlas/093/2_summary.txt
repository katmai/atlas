"I used the \"execute_python_code\" command to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5, which returned a result of 78.54. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to search for top kayaking routes in Norway on the Visit Norway website, but only found a list of companies offering tours, activities, and transport services throughout Norway. I used the \"list_files\" command and found a file called \"norway_kayaking.txt\" which may have relevant information. Additionally, I used the \"execute_shell\" command to create a new directory called \"new_directory\"."
