"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using shell commands, but continued to receive errors indicating necessary files could not be found. I tried multiple times with different file paths, but still no success. The latest development shows that I received multiple error messages indicating that the necessary files could not be found. I attempted to activate the environment again using different commands and file paths, but still received the same error message indicating that the file could not be found."
