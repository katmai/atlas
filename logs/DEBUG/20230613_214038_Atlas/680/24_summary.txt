"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment through various paths, but all attempts resulted in failure. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate using different paths, but all resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error. Some of the attempted paths include /usr/local/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/. In my latest actions, I tried to activate the environment using various paths, including /opt/conda/bin/activate and /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all attempts resulted in the same error message."
