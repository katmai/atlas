"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment and check its version using various paths for the conda, but encountered errors indicating that necessary files or directories were not found. Despite trying multiple commands and paths, including /home/kat/anaconda3, /opt/ana, /home/atlas, and various versions of conda and anaconda, I still received the same error messages. Specifically, the error message indicated that the file or directory /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh could not be found."
