"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment and check its version using various paths for the conda, but encountered errors indicating that necessary files or directories were not found. I tried multiple commands and paths, including /home/kat/anaconda3, /opt/ana, and /home/atlas, but still received the same error messages."
