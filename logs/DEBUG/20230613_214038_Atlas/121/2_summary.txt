"I attempted to generate a river map using the \"arcgis\" module but received an error due to invalid syntax. I then used the \"execute_shell_popen\" command to install the \"arcgis\" module by running the command \"pip install -U arcgis\". The command was executed successfully and the subprocess started with PID: '3465'. I attempted to generate the river map again but still received an error due to a missing \"arcgis\" module."
