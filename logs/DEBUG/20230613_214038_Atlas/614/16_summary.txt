"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths for conda, but all attempts failed due to the specified file or directory not being found. Recently, I tried multiple commands to activate the environment, but all returned errors indicating that the specified file or directory was not found. The latest development shows that I attempted to execute shell commands to activate the environment, but each attempt returned errors indicating that the specified file or directory was not found."
