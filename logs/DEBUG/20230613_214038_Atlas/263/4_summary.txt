"I attempted various shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all returned errors. The latest attempts included using paths. I tried using different paths such as /opt/conda/bin/conda and /usr/local/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all returned errors saying that the file could not be found. I also tried using the command \"conda init bash\" and \"source ~/.bashrc\" before activating the arcgis environment, but it did not work. All attempts to activate the arcgis environment using shell commands failed."
