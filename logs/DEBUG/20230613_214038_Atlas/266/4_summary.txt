"I attempted various shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all returned errors. The latest attempts included using paths, but they all returned errors saying that the file could not be found. I also tried using the command \"conda activate arcgis\" but it returned an error saying that the command was not found. I attempted multiple variations of the command, including using different paths and initializing bash, but all returned errors saying that the file or command could not be found."
