"I received a message to execute a Python code to generate a river map using the \"arcgis\" module. The command was executed and returned a subprocess with PID 3877. I connected to ArcGIS Online, created a new web map, added a feature layer to the map, and saved the web map with the title \"River Map\" and snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\". The web map included a feature layer from a URL."
