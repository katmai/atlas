"I attempted to install the 'arcgis' module using pip install arcgis with the execute_shell_popen command, which returned a subprocess PID of 4589. I received a message to execute Python code to generate a river map using the 'arcgis' module. I added the code to import necessary libraries, connect to ArcGIS Online, create a new web map, add a feature layer to the map, and save it with the title \"River Map\" and a snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\"."
