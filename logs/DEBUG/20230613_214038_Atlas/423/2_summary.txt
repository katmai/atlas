"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment and check the version using execute_shell, but all attempts resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error. I tried multiple paths, including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all returned the same error. I also tried activating the environment using ~/miniconda3/bin/activate, but it returned a \"No such file or directory\" error as well. All attempts to check the version using execute_shell returned an empty result. I received a message to execute the shell with a specific command to activate the environment and check the version, but it returned a \"No such file or directory\" error for the miniconda3/bin/activate path. I received a response to my latest attempt to execute the shell with a specific command to activate the environment and check the version, but it returned a \"No such file or directory\" error for the /root/miniconda3/bin/activate path. My latest actions involved attempting to activate the arcgis environment and check the version using execute_shell with both ~/anaconda3/bin/activate and ~/miniconda3/bin/activate paths, but both returned \"No such file or directory\" errors."
