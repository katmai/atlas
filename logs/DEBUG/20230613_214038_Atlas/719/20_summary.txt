"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths and execute_shell command, but all returned errors stating that the path did not exist or the command was not found. The latest development shows that I tried different paths and commands, including activating the environment using various paths such as /opt/anaconda3/envs/arcgispro-py3/bin/activate and /home/katmai/miniconda3/bin/activate, but they all returned errors stating that the path did not exist. The execute_shell command also returned errors stating that the command was not found."
