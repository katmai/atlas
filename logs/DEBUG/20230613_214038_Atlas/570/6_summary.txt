"I attempted multiple command lines to activate the arcgis environment, but all returned the same error message. My latest attempt involved using various paths to source the conda environment and activate arcgis, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors. Multiple attempts were made to activate the arcgis, including using paths /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate, ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all resulted in the same error message."
