"I tried multiple variations of the execute_shell command to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error. I attempted different paths and commands such as /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home, /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/bin/activate, /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, and /home/kat/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh. All attempts returned the same error."
