"I used the \"execute_shell\" command to search for rental companies and lodging options near Naeroyfjord for kayaking in Norway. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather a list of rental companies and lodging options for kayaking near Naeroyfjord in Norway, including guided tours and self-guided options. I wrote this information to a file named \"rental_lodging_options.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command, and confirmed the file was created using the \"list_files\" command."
