"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various conda paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" error messages. I tried multiple paths and commands to activate the environment, but all resulted in the same error message. I attempted to activate the environment using the command \"source /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\\\"\", but it returned a \"No such file or directory\" error message. I also attempted to activate the environment using the command \"conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\\\"\", but it returned a \"command not found\" error message."
