"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but encountered errors indicating that the necessary files could not be found. All AI suggested commands failed with the same error message. The latest attempts using \"conda activate arcgis && echo 'Environment activated.'\" and \". /opt/conda/bin/activate arcgis && echo 'Environment activated.'\" failed with an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found. The latest development involved three more AI suggested commands to activate the environment, but all failed with the same error message. The latest attempt using \"/opt/miniconda3/bin/conda activate arcgis && echo 'Environment activated.'\" also failed with an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found."
