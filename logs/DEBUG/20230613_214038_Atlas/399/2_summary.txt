"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts failed. The latest development involved multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all returned errors indicating that the necessary files or directories were not found. Specifically, I tried to activate the environment using various paths, including those for /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate, /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all attempts failed with the error message \"No such file or directory\". I attempted to activate the environment using a new command provided by the latest development, but it returned an error indicating that the necessary file or directory was not found. Specifically, the command \"source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\" returned an error message \"No such file or directory\" for the path \"/root/anaconda3/bin/activate\". The latest development involved executing two new commands to activate the environment using different paths, but both returned errors indicating that the necessary files or directories were not found. Specifically, the commands \"source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\" and \"source ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate arcgis && python -c \\\\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"\" both returned error messages \"No such file or directory\" for the paths \"/root/anaconda3/bin/activate\" and \"/root/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\", respectively."
