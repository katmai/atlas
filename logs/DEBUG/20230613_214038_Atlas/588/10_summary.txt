"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using different paths for conda.sh and activate, but all attempts returned \"No such file or directory\" error messages. I tried multiple commands with different paths, including ~/min. I received several AI responses with different command lines, but all returned the same error message indicating that the necessary files and directories could not be found."
