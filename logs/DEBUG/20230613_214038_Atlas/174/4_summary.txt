"I attempted to install 'arcgis' multiple times but received failure messages each time. I executed a series of commands to add the path to the 'arcgis' module, connect to ArcGIS Online, create a new web map, add a feature layer to the map, and save the web map. I then received a series of commands from an AI to execute Python code, check the Python version, and install 'arcgis' again using 'pip'. The 'pip show arcgis' command returned a warning that the package was not found. I executed 'pip install arcgis' again and received a subprocess with PID: '4893'."
