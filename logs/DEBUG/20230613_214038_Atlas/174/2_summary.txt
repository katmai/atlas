"I executed the command \"pip install arcgis\" using the 'execute_shell_popen' command and received a subprocess with PID: '4793'. The command returned a failure message. I then executed a series of commands to add the path to the 'arcgis' module, connect to ArcGIS Online, create a new web map, add a feature layer to the map, and save the web map. I attempted to install 'arcgis' multiple times but received failure messages each time."
