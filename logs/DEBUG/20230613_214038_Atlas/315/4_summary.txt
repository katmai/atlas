"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but encountered errors indicating that necessary files were not found. My latest action was to execute a new shell command, but it returned an error message stating that the /home/atlas/anaconda directory could not be found. I then tried to execute shell commands using the /home/atlas/miniconda directory, but encountered the same error message. Finally, I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using the /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh directory, but received an error message stating that the directory could not be found."
