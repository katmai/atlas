"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts returned an error due to missing files or directories. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all of them returned errors due to missing files or directories. Specifically, the commands tried to source files like /home/atlas/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but these files were not found. Additionally, attempts to activate the environment using paths like /home/atlas/anaconda3/bin/activate and /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate also failed due to missing files or directories. Finally, attempts to check the version of arcgis using python also failed due to the missing files or directories."
