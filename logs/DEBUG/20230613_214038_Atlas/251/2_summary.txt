"I continued to encounter errors while attempting to activate the arcgis environment using shell commands, including a message indicating that conda could not be found. My latest action was to execute a shell command to activate the environment, but it returned an error stating that the necessary file could not be found. Additionally, an AI response suggested using the \"execute_shell\" command with a specific set of arguments, but this also returned an error indicating that the \"source\" command could not be found."
