"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using execute_shell with multiple variations of the command, but all attempts returned an error message stating that the conda.sh file could not be found. Multiple attempts were made to source the conda.sh file from different directories, but all returned the same error message. The latest development shows that I tried multiple variations of the command using different directories, but all returned either a \"No such file or directory\" or \"conda: command not found\" error message."
