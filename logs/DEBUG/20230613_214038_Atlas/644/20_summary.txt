"I attempted various paths to activate the arcgis environment, but all resulted in an error indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found. Despite trying multiple paths, including /home/kat/anaconda3/bin/activate, /home/kat/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, I received the same error. I received multiple error messages when attempting to execute the shell command to activate the arcgis environment, indicating that the necessary files could not be found in directories such as /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate and /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate."
