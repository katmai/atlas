"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts returned an error message stating that the conda.sh file was not found. The latest development provided multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all returned the same error message. Additionally, I tried to check the version of arcgis using a command provided by the latest development, but it also returned an error message due to the missing conda.sh file."
