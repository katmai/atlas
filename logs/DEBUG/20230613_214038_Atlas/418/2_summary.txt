"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using execute_shell with various paths, but all attempts failed. The latest development shows multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all returned an error saying that the specified path does not exist. Specifically, I tried to activate the environment using paths such as /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all resulted in the same error message. I also tried activating the environment again using the path ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but received the same error message. I tried activating the environment using the path ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but this also resulted in the same error message. The latest development shows that I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using the paths /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all returned an error message saying that the specified path does not exist."
