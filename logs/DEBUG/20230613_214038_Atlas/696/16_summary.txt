"I attempted various commands to activate the arcgis environment using conda and bash, but all returned errors stating that the conda.sh file could not be found in various directories. I tried multiple variations of the command, but none of them worked. I tried executing shell commands with different paths to activate conda and arcgispro-py3, but all of them returned errors stating that the specified directories either did not exist or did not contain the necessary files."
