"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths and commands, but all returned a \"No such file or directory\" error message. In the latest development, I executed multiple commands to activate the environment using different paths and commands, but all returned the same error message. Specifically, I tried to activate the environment using paths for anaconda3, miniconda3, and opt/anaconda3, but all returned a \"No such file or directory\" error message. I attempted to activate the environment using the path \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/arcgispro-py3/bin/activate\" and the command \"source\", but received the same error message. I also attempted to activate the environment using paths for \"/opt/conda/envs/arcgispro-py3/bin/activate\" and \"/opt/miniconda3/envs/arcgispro-py3/bin/activate\", but both returned the same error message."
