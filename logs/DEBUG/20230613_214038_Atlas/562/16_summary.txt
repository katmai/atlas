"I continued to attempt to activate the arcgis environment using different command lines and directories, but all attempts returned a \"No such file or directory\" error. I tried various paths for the activation script, including /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate and /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but none worked. I also tried using paths for anaconda3 and opt/miniconda3, but received the same error message."
