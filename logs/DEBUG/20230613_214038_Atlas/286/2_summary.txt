"I continued to attempt to activate the arcgis environment using shell commands, but all returned errors indicating that necessary files could not be found. I tried executing the command with a different file path (\"/home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate\"), but it also resulted in an error indicating that the necessary file could not be found. I attempted to execute the same command multiple times with no success."
