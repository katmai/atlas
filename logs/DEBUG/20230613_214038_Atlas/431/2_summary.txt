"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment and check the version using execute_shell with various paths, but all returned \"No such file or directory\" errors. I then tried activating the environment using specific commands, but still received the same error message. The latest development shows that the execute_shell command returned an error message stating that the conda.sh file was not found in the specified directory. Multiple attempts were made with different paths, including ~/anaconda3 and ~/miniconda3, but all resulted in the same error message."
