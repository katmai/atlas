"I attempted multiple paths to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts resulted in an error message indicating that certain files or directories were missing. I tried executing various commands to activate the environment, including sourcing conda.sh and activating the environment using different paths, but all attempts resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error message. I received a message that executing the shell command returned a \"No such file or directory\" error for both /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate."
