"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\". The latest development shows that I tried multiple commands suggested by the AI, but all returned the same error message. The AI suggested using different paths for the conda activate command, but they all resulted in the same error message. Additionally, the latest attempt to activate the environment using a suggested path (/opt/anaconda/bin/activate) also resulted in the same error message."
