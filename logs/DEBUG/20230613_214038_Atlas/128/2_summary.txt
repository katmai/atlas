"I executed the \"execute_shell_popen\" command to install the \"arcgis\" module and it returned a subprocess with PID: '3567'. I then executed the python code to generate the river map, which includes adding the path to the 'arcgis' module and connecting to ArcGIS Online. The code adds a feature layer to the map and saves it as a web map with the title \"River Map\" and snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\". I also executed the \"execute_shell_popen\" command to check the status of the \"arcgis\" module, which returned a subprocess with PID: '3664'. Finally, I executed the \"execute_shell_popen\" command to ensure the \"arcgis\" module is installed. It returned a subprocess with PID: '3669'."
