"I received a message with a Python code to generate a river map using the \"arcgis\" module. However, the code resulted in an error due to a missing module named \"arcgis.gis\". I used the \"execute_shell\" command to install the missing module by running the command \"pip install arcgis\". Following this, I received a message that the \"execute_shell_popen\" command was executed successfully and that the subprocess started with PID: '2687'."
