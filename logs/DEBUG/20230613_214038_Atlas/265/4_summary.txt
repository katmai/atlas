"I attempted various shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all returned errors. The latest attempts included using paths, but they all returned errors saying that the file could not be found. I also tried using the command \"conda activate arcgis\" but it returned an error saying that the activate command was not found. I attempted several other commands suggested by the AI, but they all returned errors saying that conda could not be found or that certain files could not be opened."
