"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths and commands but all attempts failed due to missing conda.sh and activate files. I received an error message indicating that these files could not be found in the specified directories. I tried to execute a shell command to activate the environment again, but it returned an error message stating that the conda.sh file could not be found in the specified directory."
