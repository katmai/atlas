"I used the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to search for rental companies and lodging options near Naeroyfjord for kayaking, but it returned too much output. I then used the \"execute_shell\" command to curl search for the same information and used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information from the Google search results. I saved a list of rental companies and lodging options to a file named \"rental_lodging_options.txt\", but later deleted it. I used the \"google\" command to search for the best kayaking routes in Norway and used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on the top 10 kayaking routes recommended by Eirik Ver√•s Larsen, which I saved to a file named \"top_kayaking_routes.txt\"."
