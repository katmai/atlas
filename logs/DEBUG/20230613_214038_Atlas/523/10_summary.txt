"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using different paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors. I tried paths including /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh. I tried additional paths including /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all resulted in the same error."
