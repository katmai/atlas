"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in errors indicating missing files or directories. I tried multiple paths, including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/kat/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/kat/anaconda3/bin/activate, /usr/local/anaconda3/bin/activate, /opt/conda/bin/activate, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, but all returned the same error message: \"No such file or directory\"."
