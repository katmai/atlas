"I attempted to execute a shell command with a path to /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and conda activate, but received an error message stating that the file could not be found. I attempted to execute the command multiple times with the same result. I then attempted to execute the command with a path to /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but received the same error message."
