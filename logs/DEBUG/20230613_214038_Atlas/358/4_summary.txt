"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts returned an error due to missing files or directories. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all attempts also resulted in missing file or directory errors. Specifically, the command \"source /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" returned a \"No such file or directory\" error."
