"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all attempts returned an error message stating that the file or directory could not be found. I then tried additional paths, but still received the same error message. My latest development involved trying to activate the environment using various paths through the execute_shell command, but all attempts returned a \"No such file or directory\" error message. I tried multiple paths, including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all returned the same error message."
