"I attempted multiple commands to activate the conda environment from different directories and sources, but continued to receive \"No such file or directory\" errors for various conda.sh files. In the latest development, I tried even more commands using different conda.sh files located in various directories, but still received the same error message. Specifically, I attempted to execute multiple commands using different conda.sh files, including those located in /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/, /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/, and ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/. However, all of these attempts returned the same \"No such file or directory\" error message. Additionally, I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various commands, but all of these attempts also failed."
