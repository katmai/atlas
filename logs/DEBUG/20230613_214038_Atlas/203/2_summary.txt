"I attempted to activate the environment using various commands with paths to conda.sh and bin/activate, but all returned the same error message. The AI suggested executing a shell command with a path to conda/bin/activate, but it also returned the same error message stating that the file could not be found. In response, the AI suggested executing a shell command with a path to /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and conda activate, which I tried and successfully activated the environment."
