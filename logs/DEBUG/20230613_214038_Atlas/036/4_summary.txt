"I attempted to use \"get_hyperlinks\" on a ScienceDirect page, but received an HTTP 403 error. I then used \"google\" to search for \"river restoration techniques\" and received several links. I used \"browse_website\" to gather information on the River Restoration Centre's website, which provided detailed examples of river restoration techniques including restoring meanders, improving channel morphology, removing or bypassing barriers, and green bank protection. I also used \"read_file\" to gather information on the evolution, challenges, and limitations of river restoration techniques in Europe. Finally, I used \"write_to_file\" to summarize the information gathered and saved it to \"river_restoration_summary.txt\". I then used \"list_files\" to confirm the file was created."
