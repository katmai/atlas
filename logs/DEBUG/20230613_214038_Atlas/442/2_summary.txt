"I tried using the execute_shell command with different paths (/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh), but received error messages indicating that the necessary conda.sh file could not be found. The latest attempt involved using the path /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh."
