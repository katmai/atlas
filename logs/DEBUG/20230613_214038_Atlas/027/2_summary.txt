"I successfully used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on river restoration techniques from the website \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/river-restoration\". The website provided information on the evolution, challenges, and limitations of river restoration techniques in Europe, emphasizing the importance of natural processes and dynamic flow regimes. The text also suggested a shift towards larger-scale projects and interdisciplinary approaches, and highlighted the need for post-project evaluation and monitoring. The greatest threats to progress were identified as human population growth and climate change."
