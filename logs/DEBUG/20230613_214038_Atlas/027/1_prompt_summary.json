The importance of considering natural processes and dynamic flow regimes is emphasized, and successful case studies are presented. The text also suggests a shift towards larger-scale projects and a focus on hyporheic processes, riparian zones, floodplains, and backwaters, and emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches and post-project evaluation and monitoring. The greatest threats to progress are human population growth and climate change.\\n\\nLinks: ['\\\\nSkip to Main content\\\\n (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/river-restoration#main_content)', 'ScienceDirect (https://www.sciencedirect.com/)', 'Journals & Books (https://www.sciencedirect.com/browse/journals-and-books)', ' (https://www.sciencedirect.com/search)', 'Search (https://www.sciencedirect.com/search)']\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
