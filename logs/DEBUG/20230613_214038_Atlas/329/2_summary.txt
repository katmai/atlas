"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using shell commands, but received errors indicating that the activation files were not found. I tried activating the environment using various paths, including /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /home/atlas/anaconda/bin/activate, but all resulted in the same error message. The latest development involved attempting to activate the environment using multiple paths, but each attempt resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error message. The computer returned a series of error messages for each attempted activation command, indicating that the specified files or directories were not found. I attempted to activate the environment using additional paths, including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but each attempt resulted in the same error message. I also attempted to activate the environment using paths specific to my user account, including /home/atlas/anaconda/bin/activate and /home/atlas/miniconda/bin/activate, but each attempt resulted in the same error message."
