"I used the command \"google\" to search for \"How to turn a river into a lake\" and received a list of URLs from my computer. I then used the command \"browse_website\" to find information on how the lake along the Arkansas River corridor was created. The search returned that Tulsa, Jenks, and the Muscogee Creek National Council approved an $8.2 million project to create a new lake in the Arkansas River corridor with a marina, trail system, and reinforced shoreline. The lake will be from 71st to 101st, where the dam will hold water as deep as 10 feet. The project is dependent on reaching an agreement with the Muscogee Nation to create a Tax Increment Financing District to pay for the infrastructure."
