"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths for conda, but all attempts failed and returned errors. The latest development shows that none of the paths for conda activation worked and returned a \"No such file or directory\" error. Multiple attempts were made with different paths, including /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate and /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all resulted in the same error."
