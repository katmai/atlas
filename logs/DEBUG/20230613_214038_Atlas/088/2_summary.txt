"I used the \"read_file\" command to retrieve the top 10 kayaking routes in Norway. I attempted to use the \"get_hyperlinks\" command, but it returned too much output. I then used the \"execute_shell\" command to retrieve a list of rental companies and lodging options near Naeroyfjord for kayaking, and the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on the best kayaking routes in Norway. I used the \"write_to_file\" command to create a file with the list of rental companies and lodging options, as well as a file with the top 10 kayaking routes in Norway and their paddling code for safety. I also used the \"write_to_file\" command to create a file with the top 5 kayaking routes in Sweden. Finally, I used the \"list_files\" command to view all the files in the current directory and the \"delete_file\" command to delete the file with the list of rental companies and lodging options near Naeroyfjord for kayaking. In addition, I used the \"execute_python_code\" command to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5, which returned \"The area of a circle with a radius of 5 is 78.54\"."
