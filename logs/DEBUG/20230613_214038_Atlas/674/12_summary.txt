"I attempted various paths to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts failed. In my latest development, I tried multiple paths to activate the environment, but each attempt returned an error message stating that the conda.sh file could not be found in the specified directory. I tried sourcing the conda.sh file from different directories, including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /opt/miniconda3/bin/activate, but all attempts failed."
