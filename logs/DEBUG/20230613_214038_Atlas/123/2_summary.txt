"I attempted to generate a river map using the \"arcgis\" module but received an error due to invalid syntax. I then used the \"execute_shell_popen\" command to install the \"arcgis\" module by running the command \"pip install -U arcgis\". The command was executed successfully and the subprocess started with PID: '3465'. However, I attempted to generate the river map again but still received an error due to a missing \"arcgis\" module. I then tried to install the \"arcgis\" module using the \"execute_shell_popen\" command multiple times, but still received the same error. I received multiple error messages saying that the arcgis module is not found. I tried to install the arcgis module multiple times using the execute_shell_popen command, but it did not work. I also tried to execute the python code to generate the river map, but it still failed due to the missing arcgis module. I then used the execute_shell_popen command to check if the arcgis module is installed by running the command \"pip show arcgis\". I received a subprocess with PID: '3562'. Lastly, I tried to execute the python code to generate the river map again, but it still failed."
