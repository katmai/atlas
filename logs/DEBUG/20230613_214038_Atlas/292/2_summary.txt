"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using shell commands but received multiple error messages indicating that necessary files could not be found. Specifically, I tried activating the environment using '/home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate' and '/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh' but received error messages indicating that these files could not be found. I then tried activating the environment using '/opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh' but received the same error message."
