"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts returned an error due to the specified directories not existing. I tried using different paths for conda activation, but they also returned errors. The latest development involved executing shell commands. I executed three different shell commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all returned errors stating that the specified directories do not exist. I also attempted to check the arcgis version, but it also returned an error due to the missing directories."
