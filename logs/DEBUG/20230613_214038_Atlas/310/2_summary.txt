"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but encountered errors indicating that necessary files were not found. My latest action was to execute a new shell command, but it returned an error message stating that the /home/atlas/anaconda/bin/activate file was not found. In response to my latest action, I received an error message indicating that the file was not found in any of the specified directories. The latest attempt to activate the environment using a new command also returned an error message stating that the file was not found. I received a response from the AI indicating that the execute_shell command was not successful and returned an error message stating that the /home/atlas/anaconda/bin/activate file was not found."
