"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment multiple times using various command lines and directories, but all attempts returned a \"No such file or directory\" error. I tried multiple command lines with different directories, including the directories \"/opt/anaconda/bin/activate\", \"/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\", \"/home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\", \"/home/katmai/miniconda3/bin/activate arcgis\", \"/home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate arcgis\", \"/home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\", \"/home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate\", and \"/opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\". However, all attempts still returned the same error message."
