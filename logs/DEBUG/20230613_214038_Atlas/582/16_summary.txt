"I attempted multiple command lines to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts failed due to the \"No such file\" error. I tried activating using different paths such as /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh and /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but still encountered the same error. The AI responded with messages containing the command executed and the resulting STDOUT and STDERR. However, none of the attempts were successful in activating the arcgis environment."
