"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors. In response to my latest attempt, I received multiple \"action_result\" messages indicating that the activate command failed due to a missing conda. Most of the attempts involved sourcing different paths for conda. The latest development includes multiple failed attempts to activate the arcgis environment using different paths for conda, resulting in \"No such file or directory\" errors."
