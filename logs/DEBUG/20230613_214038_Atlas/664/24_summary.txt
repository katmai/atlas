"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using execute_shell, but all attempts returned \"No such file or directory\" errors. Multiple attempts were made with different paths, including /opt/miniconda3. The latest attempts included sourcing /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda. I tried to activate the arcgispro-py3 environment using execute_shell with the command \"bash -c 'source /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate && conda activate arcgispro-py3 && python -c \\\"import arcgis; print(arcgis.__version__)\\\"'\", but received a \"No such file or directory\" error for /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate."
