"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various commands and conda files located in different directories, but all attempts failed with a \"No such file or directory\" error. I then tried executing a command, but it also failed. The latest development shows that I tried multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment, but all returned a \"No such file or directory\" error."
