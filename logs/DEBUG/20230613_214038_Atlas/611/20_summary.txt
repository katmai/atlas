"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths for conda, but received multiple errors. The latest development shows that I continued to run the same command with different paths, but all resulted in the same error message: \"No such file or directory\". I tried multiple paths for conda, including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /usr/local/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, but all resulted in the same error message."
