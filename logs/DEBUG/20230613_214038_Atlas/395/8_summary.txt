"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths provided by the latest development, but all attempts failed. The latest development involved multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths, but all returned errors indicating that the necessary files or directories were not found. Specifically, I tried to activate the environment using various paths, including those for /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate, /home/atlas/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all attempts failed with the error message \"No such file or directory\"."
