"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths, but all resulted in errors indicating that the conda.sh file could not be found. The latest development shows that I tried multiple commands to activate the environment, but received the same error message each time. Specifically, I attempted to activate the environment using paths for anaconda3/bin/activate, anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but each attempt resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error message for the conda.sh file. I also attempted to activate the environment using paths for /home/kat/anaconda3/bin/activate and /opt/anaconda3/bin/activate, but received the same error message for each path."
