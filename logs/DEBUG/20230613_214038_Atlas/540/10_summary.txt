"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths and commands but all attempts failed due to missing conda.sh and activate files. Despite trying multiple shell commands to activate the environment, I received error messages indicating the files were missing. The latest development includes multiple attempts to activate the environment using different paths and commands, but all attempts failed due to missing conda.sh and activate files."
