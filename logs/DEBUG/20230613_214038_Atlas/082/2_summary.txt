"I used the \"browse_website\" command to search for the best kayaking routes in Norway on the website https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/canoeing-kayaking/top-places-to-paddle/ and received a list of the top 10 kayaking routes recommended by Eirik Ver√•s Larsen, along with a paddling code for safety. The website also provided tips and a list of companies for various outdoor activities, but there was an advertisement for skiing with no information on kayaking routes. The links provided were: https://www.visitnorway.com/, https://www.visitnorway.com/, https://www.visitnorway.com/search/?q=, https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/, and https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/fjord-norway/."
