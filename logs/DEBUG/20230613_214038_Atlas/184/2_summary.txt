"I attempted to install the \"arcgis\" module using \"pip install -U arcgis\" and added the correct path to the system path using \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages\". However, when attempting to generate a river map using the module, I received a \"No module named 'arcgis'\" error. I tried to add the path to the module using \"sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/arcgis')\" and attempted to generate the river map again, but received the same error. I then tried to add the path to the module using \"sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages')\" and attempted to generate the river map again, but received the same error. I checked if the module was installed using \"pip list | grep arcgis\" but received no output. I then tried to install the module again using \"pip install arcgis\" and attempted to generate the river map, but received the same error."
