"I received multiple messages to install the \"arcgis\" module using the \"pip install arcgis\" command, but it returned errors. I then executed the command \"pip install -U arcgis\" multiple times. I received various messages from the AI, including executing shell and Python code. I added the path to the 'arcgis' module and connected to ArcGIS Online. I created a new web map and added a feature layer to it. I saved the web map with the title \"River Map\" and a snippet \"A map of rivers in the USA\". I also executed the command \"pip list | grep arcgis\" and \"pip show arcgis | grep Location\". I encountered an error when executing \"pip install arcgis\" and was advised not to execute the command again with the same arguments."
