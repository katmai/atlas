"I attempted to install the \"arcgis\" module using \"pip install -U arcgis\" and added the correct path to the system path using \"export PATH=$PATH:/. However, when attempting to generate a river map using the module, I received a ModuleNotFoundError. I attempted to add the path to the system path again, but this did not work. I then tried installing the module using \"pip install arcgis\" and added the path to the system path again, but still received the same error. I also checked the version of Python being used and it is Python 3. I attempted to generate the river map again, but still received the same error."
