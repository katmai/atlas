"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various commands, but all attempts failed with a \"No such file or directory\" error. I tried multiple commands using different conda.sh files located in various directories, including those located in /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/, /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/, /home/kat. However, all attempts failed. I then tried executing a command to activate the environment using a specific conda file located in /opt/conda/bin/activate, but it returned a \"No such file or directory\" error. I also tried different conda files located in /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/ and ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/, but they also returned the same error. Finally, I tried using a conda file located in ~/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/, but it also returned the same error."
