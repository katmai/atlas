"I attempted multiple command lines to activate the arcgis environment, but all attempts failed due to missing files. I tried various paths including /opt/anaconda3, /opt/miniconda3, /home/kat/anaconda3, /opt/conda/bin/activate, /opt/anaconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /home/kat/. Most of the attempts returned a 'No such file or directory' error. Recently, I tried executing a command line to activate the arcgis environment using the path /home/atlas/miniconda3/bin/activate, but it returned a 'No such file or directory' error as well."
