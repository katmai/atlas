"I attempted multiple commands with different paths to activate the arcgis environment, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors. The latest development shows that I tried even more commands with different paths and received similar errors. Specifically, I tried executing multiple shell commands with different paths, including /opt/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /home/katmai/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, and /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, but all returned the same error."
