"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various shell commands, but received error messages indicating that the necessary files were not found. The error message consistently indicated that the conda.sh file was not found. In response to my latest action, I received an error message indicating that the conda.sh file was not found in any of the specified directories. My latest attempt to activate the environment using a new command returned an error message stating that the /home/atlas/anaconda/bin/activate file was not found. My latest action was to execute a new shell command, but the returned message showed that the /home/atlas/miniconda/bin/activate file was not found, leading to another failed attempt to activate the environment."
