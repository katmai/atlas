"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using shell commands, but continued to receive errors indicating necessary files could not be found. Despite trying different commands and file paths, I still received the same error message indicating that the file could not be found. The latest development shows that I received multiple error messages indicating that the necessary files could not be found, and I attempted to activate the environment again using various commands and file paths, but to no avail."
