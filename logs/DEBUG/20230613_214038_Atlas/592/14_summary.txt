"I attempted multiple commands to activate the arcgis environment using different paths for conda.sh and activate, but all resulted in \"No such file or directory\" errors. I tried various paths including /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh, /opt/conda/etc. My latest attempt was to execute a shell command with a specific path to conda.sh and activate arcgis, but it still resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error."
