"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment using various paths and execute_shell command, but all returned errors stating that the path did not exist. Despite multiple attempts with different paths, the issue persisted. The latest development shows that I attempted to activate the environment using various paths, but each attempt returned an error stating that the path did not exist. Specifically, I tried activating the environment using paths for conda.sh and activate files in both /opt/miniconda3 and /opt/anaconda3 directories, as well as in /home/katmai/miniconda3 and /home/katmai/anaconda3 directories, but all attempts resulted in a \"No such file or directory\" error."
