"I attempted to activate the arcgis environment multiple times, but all resulted in a \"No\". I received several messages attempting to execute a shell command, but all returned an error stating that the conda.sh file could not be found in various directories. I tried executing the shell command with a different directory (/opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh), but it still returned an error saying that the file could not be found."
