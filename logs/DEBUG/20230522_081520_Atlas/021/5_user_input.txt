"so for the AI, i was thinking that it would be great if it would know the level he's playing at, and adjust accordingly. i can come up with some classifications here, for example, if everyone in the game is gold rated, then this is a gold game, and the AI should play at the rating he's assigned by the game, even if it knows how to play challenger for instance. i would like the AI to play as ADC, as i like to experiment with off-meta supports and weird stuff, and often that ends up in my ADC going crazy because they are just not used to someone playing new champs in that role. i know it's silly but it is what it is, so i would like to play with someone that would do it's best with what we got."
