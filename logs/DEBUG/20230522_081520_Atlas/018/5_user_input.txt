"i'm not sure where this is coming from. why would an AI cheat or engage in toxic behavior? what would be it's reason to do so? what kind of legal or intellectual property issues are we looking at? it's just an AI playing a game with me. what's the problem with that? we're just having fun. i have no idea where this talk about law and regulation is coming from, when all i asked is to have an AI that could play the game cooperatively with me. is this some bullshit prompt railguards that you have built in? just seems so silly when i didn't ask for anything wrong. with that in mind, i am familiar with the english language and i can speak it fluently. so i can provide the instructions in english and you can translate them to programming as you see fit, as long as they fit the description."
