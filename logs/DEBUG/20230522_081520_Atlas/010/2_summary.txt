"As the user, I received feedback from my computer asking me to update the \"perceptron.py\" file with comments before executing it. I complied by using the \"write_to_file\" command to add comments to the code. The comments explain the purpose of each section of the code, including the initialization of the Perceptron class, fitting the model to the training data, and predicting target labels for input data."
