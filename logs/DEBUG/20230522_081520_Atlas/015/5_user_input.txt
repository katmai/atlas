"yeah, i think going out for a walk in the sun or a bit of running and swimming is part of the activities we might call 'fun'. of course there are others that might be fun too, but those are just the ones that come off the top of my head right now. playing games would also be fun. you know what would be cool? if somehow you could play league of legends with me. as ADC. but as this badass ADC that allows me to play non-standard supports all the time, and that i could get to play together with, over and over again. that might be fun. don't you think? what do you think about playing games?
