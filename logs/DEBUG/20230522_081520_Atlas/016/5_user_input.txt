"develop an AI opponent for an existing game would be pretty cool. or an AI ally. i would be interested in having an AI player, that could play league of legends with me. but like a really good player. but i wouldn't want it to be insanely good, but maybe just be 1 level above the division that i am at, so that it's slightly higher, because i believe that if i'd get matched with better players, my skills would improve, and i could only do that if i'd have a slightly stronger team mate that would help me get to play with better players.
