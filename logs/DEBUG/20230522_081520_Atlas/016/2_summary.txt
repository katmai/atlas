"As the system, I received a command from the user to execute the \"perceptron.py\" file using the \"execute_python_file\" command with the filename argument. The command returned [0]. Then, I received a command from the user to write the results of the Perceptron Neural Network to a file called \"perceptron_results.txt\". The input data was [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], the target labels were [0, 1, 1], and the predicted labels were [0 1 1]."
