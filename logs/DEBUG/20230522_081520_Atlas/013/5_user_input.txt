"i was trying to understand something while going into this, and i think i understood that i don't really need a perceptron. i don't really need to classify anything to be honest :) i was just curious if we could make a small neural network, but when faced with what we think a neural network is, i have this awkward feeling that what we have right now, with this code, is much less than what the brain is. anyway, thanks for helping me out. got any other bright ideas?"
