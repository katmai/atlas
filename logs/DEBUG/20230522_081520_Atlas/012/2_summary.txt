"As the user, I received a command to execute the \"perceptron.py\" file on my computer. I complied and the command returned a result. Previously, I had added comments to the code using the \"write_to_file\" command, explaining each section of the code. I received feedback from my computer that the script doesn't have any output, and I wondered if it requires any inputs when running and if there is any expected output to produce. I then added code to the \"perceptron.py\" file for building a perceptron neural network, including functions for fitting the model to training data and predicting target labels for input data. I also tested the model on sample data and printed the predicted output."
