It is important to consider the potential ethical implications of developing AI for gaming, but I understand that you simply want an AI ally to play cooperatively with you. As for the technical aspects of developing an AI ally for League of Legends, we will need to use a combination of machine learning and game-specific programming to create an AI that can play the game at a high level. Python is a popular language for machine learning, and there are several libraries available that can be used for this purpose. We will also need to use a League of Legends API to interact with the game and gather data on gameplay. Do you have any experience with Python or machine learning?",
