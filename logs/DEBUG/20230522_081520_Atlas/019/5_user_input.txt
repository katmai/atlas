"thank you for understanding that all i am looking for is to create an AI that can play the game with me, for fun and for the purpose of getting better at the game. as far as API goes, i am not really sure if League of Legends has an API. but i know that there have been several AI players created, for DotA2 for instance, that were able to learn the game and become very good at it. so i think maybe we'd want to draw inspiration into how they were able to do that, and adjust it for League of Legends. We would probably need the programs to run on Windows, because that is where league of legends runs best. or Mac, but Macs are expensive and i don't have the funds right now to buy a new Mac laptop for this purpose.
