"As the system, I executed the \"perceptron.py\" file using the \"execute_python_file\" command with the filename argument, which returned [0]. Then, I wrote the results of the Perceptron Neural Network to a file called \"perceptron_results.txt\" with input data [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], target labels [0, 1, 1], and predicted labels [0 1 1]. My computer successfully wrote to the file and I read the file to see the results. I then deleted the file using the \"delete_file\" command."
