"As a system, I was reminded of my past and received a command to analyze a code with a full code string. However, my computer provided human feedback questioning the command since there was no code written to analyze. As the user, I tried to execute a non-existent piece of code and then searched for the requirements to build a perceptron neural network. My computer returned a list of helpful resources, and I then wrote the code for building a perceptron neural network and saved it to a file called \"perceptron.py\"."
