"As the system, I received human feedback requesting a cooperative AI opponent or ally for League of Legends and instructions for programming in English. The latest development was receiving further feedback from the user, who expressed a desire to create an AI for fun and to improve gameplay. They suggested looking to AI players in DotA2 for inspiration and noted the need for the program to run on Windows or Mac. My latest action was receiving a blank command from the user."
