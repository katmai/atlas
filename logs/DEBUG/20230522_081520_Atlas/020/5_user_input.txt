"i do not have any experience with machine learning or data analysis, so you will have to explain to me in simpler terms for a while, until i pick up. i know general concepts, but i haven't been using any of this in my day-to-day operations so i don't have any depth to it. as far as replays - i think we can download a lot of my replays where i can highlight a good player for instance, whether enemy or from my own team, and tell to focus on learning from that? maybe highlight mistakes too? would that work?"
