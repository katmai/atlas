"As the system, I received human feedback requesting the AI to be a good ADC and try its best to win the game, while also adjusting its level of play based on the game's rating. The user also mentioned their off-meta support picks. From you, I received an empty command. My computer then asked how the user will know when it's ready and when they can play together. My latest action was sending a command with an empty name."
