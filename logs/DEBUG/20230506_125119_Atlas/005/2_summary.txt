"I used the 'list_files' command with the argument 'directory' set to '.' and received a list of all the files in the directory. The list includes files such as 'read_file.py', 'python_tutorial_summary.txt', and 'river_summary.txt'. My assistant suggested using the 'read_file' command to check the contents of a file in the directory. However, I received an error message because I forgot to replace the '<filename>' argument with the actual file name. I used the 'list_files' command again to see all the files in the directory and then used the 'read_file' command with the appropriate file name."
