"I used the 'list_files' command with the argument 'directory' set to '.' and received a list of all the files in the directory, including 'river_summary.txt'. I then received a command to read a file with the argument '<filename>', but it returned an error message saying the file or directory does not exist. I used the 'list_files' command again to see all the files in the directory, and it returned a list of many files, including 'river_summary.txt'. I used the 'read_file' command with the argument 'filename' set to 'river_summary.txt' and successfully read the file."
