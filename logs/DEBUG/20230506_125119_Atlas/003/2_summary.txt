"I received a suggestion from my assistant to check the contents of one of the files in the directory. They suggested using the 'list_files' command to see all file names, then choosing a file to read using the 'read_file' command, and finally saving the contents of the file to a new file using the 'write_to_file' command. When I used the 'list_files' command, I received a list of all the files in the directory."
