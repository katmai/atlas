"the redis is not running in this docker container. it runs in a separate container that is being accessed via a python module, from this application. the files that reference redis actions in the code, are located in /home/atlas/autogpt/config/config.py, /home/atlas/autogpt/memory/__init__.py and /home/atlas/autogpt/memory/redismem.py. i can ensure you that redis is running and you don't need to ping it, but if you want to create a piece of code that can use the already installed python redis library, to connect to the redis container using the hostname: redis, port 6379 and without a password, you can do that."
