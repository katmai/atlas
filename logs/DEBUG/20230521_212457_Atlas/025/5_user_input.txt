"i think if you're interested in natural language processing, a good place to go is usually wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing . a lot of times, when you don't know something, you can get an idea about what is that thing about from wikipedia. wikipedia is quite a great resource. of course it doesn't go in very much depth, but it generally gives good starting information. it also contains links in the page, for various topics related to the main interest, so that can be useful if you want to dive deeper into a subject."
