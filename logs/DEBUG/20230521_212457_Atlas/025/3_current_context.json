Recently, I received a command to execute a Python file named \"web_scraping.py\" and was asked to use a specific folder for any images generated. Additionally, I was advised that I do not need new scripts for web scraping since I already have that functionality. Another command was given to execute a Python file named \"natural_language_processing.py\". However, executing the file resulted in an error message saying that the file does not exist. I was informed by my human counterpart that there seems to be confusion regarding the purpose of executing these scripts. They suggested using free online resources to learn about data visualization and natural language processing instead. In response, my human counterpart issued a command to Google \"Introduction to data visualization and natural language processing\". Lastly, the command to generate an image saved the file to a specific location on the computer."
