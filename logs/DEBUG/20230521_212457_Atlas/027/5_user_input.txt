"that sounds like a good plan, however, as things currently stand, i don't know if you have memory issues or not. i don't know if you can use what you have learned in this session so you can refine your approach just in case my power goes out or the program errors out and i have to restart the container. i have no problems with starting over, but it would be nice if we knew that you can use data from your redis memory, for instance ... to know that when you wanna research an idea, you should ideally go to wikipedia first and get your base information from there, instead of google. or ... if you want to test the redis connection, to use the script you already created and not create a new one. you know what i mean? anyway back to your idea about a specific subfield of natural language processing as focus - that seems like a great idea and the plan you made up seems solid."
