"I received human feedback that the Redis cache is not running in my Docker container and is being accessed via a Python module. The relevant files are located in /home/atlas/autogpt/config/config.py, /home/atlas/autogpt/memory/__init__.py and /home/atlas/autogpt/memory/redismem.py. I was advised that I don't need to ping Redis, but I can create a code to connect to the Redis container using the hostname: redis, port 6379 and without a password. I executed the command \"pip show redis\" using the execute_shell command."
