"can you please use your workspace folder located at : /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace for storing any scripts/readme/images please? this way everything will be more organized. that folder is mounted as volume in this docker container, so the contents get saved if this session errors out. if you put things outside the workspace folder, because it's a docker container, they will be gone if they are not saved inside that mounted volume folder.
