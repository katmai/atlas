"being difficult or easy is a matter of if i am trying to convince someone to provide funding. while i do not intend to convince anyone of something they don't believe in. i'd just like the opportunity to say my story. if they would happen to like it, want to know more, ask more questions, have a discussion, get more details - great. if not - it's also great, but at least someone listened. as far as this seen as a risky investment - i am not saying this is an investment, in fact this will most likely bring no financial rewards to the persons i am asking funds from. there will be rewards, however. come on, man, we're talking about \"risky investments\" when asking for a few millions from billionnaires. that seems like a little bit of stretch doesn't it? as far as building a strong network of supporters - i am not really interested in that. i want to be alone in the beginning, doing this, so i can figure out if what i want to do has meaning and it's a good thing. if after i start doing it people will start to like what i do and will want to tag along, because it makes them happy and it feels like it brings value to people - that would be a great thing. but in the beginning i would like to be just me, doing it all by myself."
