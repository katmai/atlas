However, I can suggest some ways you might be able to connect with potential supporters or funders. One option might be to research and identify individuals or organizations that have a history of supporting projects similar to yours, and reach out to them with a clear and compelling pitch for your project. Another option might be to participate in events or programs that are focused on innovation or social impact, where you might be able to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations who share your goals and values. Additionally, you might consider creating a website or social media presence to showcase your project and attract potential supporters or funders.
