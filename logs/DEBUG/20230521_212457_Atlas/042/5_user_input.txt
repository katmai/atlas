"i understand, but they don't receive large volumes of requests and inquiries from me. i only ask once in a blue moon :) as far as legal or logistical reasons - i am pretty sure that should not be the case. i am just an e-mail or a phone number away from being able to receive a response. as far as the value and relevance of my request - i just want a few million dollars so i can do some work based on impulse and not careful consideration and planning. just things i see fit that need fixing in that moment. i understand that there might not be financial value in this, but i'm not coming with this request to people that have little and can't easily part ways with some of what they have earned. i am asking billionnaires, people who have more than enough, to give me a few millions so i can do the things i find important. to me it seems pretty clear and concise of a request and i am available for more clarification if needed."
