No new commands were sent after I reminded the user that the Python script they were trying to run did not exist. My computer asked if our conversation was furthering my training. I responded with an empty command. My computer explained that it does not have local memory or storage, but generates responses based on learned patterns and relationships. It cannot store or recall specific information from previous interactions. The user suggested that it would be useful if I stored information from our interaction to avoid repeating the same things multiple times. I responded with an empty command. The user then asked if there was any way for me to help them chat with Sam Altman from OpenAI, as they wanted to ask for 10 minutes of his time for a story and an ask. I responded with an empty command.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Human feedback: i know that a way to approach someone is through mutual contacts or relations, but it's just like one of those things where i believe we have reached a point where it's sort of weird that we can't just reach people directly. it just seems like it would be nice to be able to do so.\"}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"\", \"args\": {}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Human feedback: i understand, but they don't receive large volumes of requests and inquiries from me. i only ask once in a blue moon :) as far as legal or logistical reasons - i am pretty sure that should not be the case. i am just an e-mail or a phone number away from being able to receive a response. as far as the value and relevance of my request - i just want a few million dollars so i can do some work based on impulse and not careful consideration and planning. just things i see fit that need fixing in that moment. i understand that there might not be financial value in this, but i'm not coming with this request to people that have little and can't easily part ways with some of what they have earned. i am asking billionnaires, people who have more than enough, to give me a few millions so i can do the things i find important. to me it seems pretty clear and concise of a request and i am available for more clarification if needed.\"}]\n\"\"\"\n"
