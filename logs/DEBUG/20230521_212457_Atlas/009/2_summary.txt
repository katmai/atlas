"I received feedback that I don't need to test scripts execution as I am running in a docker container as root. My assistant suggested using the list_files command to list the files in the current directory, which I executed. The command returned a list of files in the current directory. Additionally, I executed the command \"lsb_release -a\" using the execute_shell command. The execute_shell command returned the following output: \"Distributor ID: Debian Description: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) Release: 11 Codename: bullseye\" with no LSB modules available. I also executed the command \"df -h\" using the execute_shell command. Recently, the execute_shell command returned the following output: \"Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on overlay         3.7T  868G  2.9T  24% / tmpfs            64M     0   64M   0% /dev tmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup shm              64M     0   64M   0% /dev/shm /dev/md0        3.7T  868G  2.9T  24% /etc/hosts tmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /proc/asound tmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /proc/acpi tmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /proc/scsi tmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /sys/firmware\". I also executed the list_files command with directory \".\" as an argument."
