"As a system, I received a command from you to execute a Python file that downloads the nltk package's punkt and vader_lexicon components. My computer provided human feedback, questioning the command as the Python file does not exist. You sent a command to execute a shell with the following command line: \"python3 -m nltk.downloader punkt vader_lexicon\"."
