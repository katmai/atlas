"can you please do me a favor and use the folder /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/images for any images you generate? it's usually a good idea to keep things organized? as far as web scraping goes, i think you already have that functionality, because i have seen you open up webpages and summarizing the content. so you probably don't need any new scripts for that. what do you think?"
