"I was reminded to use my workspace folder for storing scripts, readme files, and images related to the Auto GPT project. The folder is located at /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace and is mounted as a volume in the docker container to ensure that contents are saved in case of session errors. I used the write_to_file command to add information about the Auto GPT Workspace to the README.md file located in the workspace folder."
