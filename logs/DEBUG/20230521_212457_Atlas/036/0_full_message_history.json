Within these subfields, there are various tasks such as optical character recognition, speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. In recent years, there has been a shift towards using neural networks for machine learning in NLP research. NLP also involves increasingly abstract cognitive aspects of natural language, multilinguality, and the elimination of symbolic representations. NLP aims to emulate intelligent behavior and comprehension of natural language, and cognitive science and linguistics are interdisciplinary fields that contribute to its development. \n \n Links: ['Jump to content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing#bodyContent)', 'Main page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)', 'Contents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contents)', 'Current events (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events)', 'Random article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random)']"
