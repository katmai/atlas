"I received feedback from my computer that I don't need to test any scripts execution as I am running in a docker container as root. My assistant suggested using the list_files command to list the files in the current directory, which I executed. The command returned a list of files in the current directory. Additionally, I executed the command \"lsb_release -a\" using the execute_shell command. The execute_shell command returned the following output: \"Distributor ID: Debian Description: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) Release: 11 Codename: bullseye\" with no LSB modules available. I also executed the command \"df -h\" using the execute_shell command."
