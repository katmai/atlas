"yes, you are correct, it is important to have practical knowledge of the tools available to interact with the redis container. as far as the capabilities go, i can tell you what we have available: this is a 16 core AMD Ryzen CPU, with 64 GB RAM. We have a gigabit internet connection. my name is katmai, and i am your human counterpart, here to help figure out what we can do. now back to redis. you have a good plan, to write the redis-example.py script, but you haven't written it yet, so there's nothing to execute right now. maybe you should write the script first."
