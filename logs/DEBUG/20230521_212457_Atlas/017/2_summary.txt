"I successfully used the write_to_file command to add information about the Auto GPT Workspace to the README.md file located in the workspace folder. The command returned \"File written to successfully.\" Then, I appended information about the redis_example.py script to the same README.md file using the append_to_file command, which included demonstrating how to connect to the redis container and perform basic operations using the python redis library."
