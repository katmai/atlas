Recently, as an assistant, I realized that I made a mistake in the previous command to move all files to the \"auto_gpt_workspace\" directory, as it was trying to move the directory into itself. I modified the command to exclude the \"auto_gpt_workspace\" directory from the copy operation by using the \"--exclude\" option with the \"cp\" command. The new command is \"cp -r --exclude=\\'auto_gpt_workspace\\' ./* auto_gpt_workspace && rm -r ./*\".'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\nNothing new happened.\n\"\"\"\n"
