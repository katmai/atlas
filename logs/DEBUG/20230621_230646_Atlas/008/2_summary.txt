"I was commanded to google \"advanced propulsion systems for interstellar travel\" and my computer returned a list of links, including articles on interstellar travel, a traveler's guide to the stars, and advanced propulsion systems for interstellar travel. The links also included information on the physics of interstellar travel, antimatter propulsion, and a book on advanced propulsion systems."
