        "text": "After reviewing the search results, I have found that one potential advancement in technology that could make interstellar travel more feasible is the development of advanced propulsion systems. One such system is the fusion engine, which uses nuclear fusion to generate energy. This technology has the potential to provide a nearly limitless source of energy for interstellar travel, but it is still in the early stages of development and faces significant challenges, such as the need to achieve and maintain the high temperatures and pressures required for nuclear fusion. Another potential propulsion system is the antimatter engine, which uses the annihilation of matter and antimatter to generate energy. While this technology is still largely theoretical, it has the potential to provide even greater energy efficiency than fusion engines. However, the production and storage of antimatter is currently very difficult and expensive. I will need to conduct further research to determine the feasibility of these propulsion systems for interstellar travel.",
