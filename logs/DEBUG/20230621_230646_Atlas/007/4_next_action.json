        "text": "After reviewing the search results, I have found that one potential advancement in technology that could make interstellar travel more feasible is the development of advanced materials that can withstand the extreme conditions of interstellar space. These materials would need to be strong enough to withstand the impact of high-speed particles and radiation, as well as the extreme temperatures and pressures of interstellar space. There are several materials that have been proposed for this purpose, including graphene and carbon nanotubes. While these materials are still in the early stages of development, they have the potential to significantly increase the durability and reliability of spacecraft for interstellar travel. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome, such as the cost and scalability of these materials. I will need to conduct further research to determine the feasibility of these materials for interstellar travel.",
