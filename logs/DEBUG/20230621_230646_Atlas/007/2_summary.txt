"I was commanded to google \"warp drive for interstellar travel\" and found several links related to the topic, including articles on NASA's research on warp drive, physicists giving boost to faster than light space travel, and Alcubierre drive. My computer returned a list of links, including information on warp drive research being key to interstellar travel and what's needed for interstellar travel according to a NASA technologist."
