"I was commanded to google advancements for interstellar travel and found several links related to the topic. I received a new command to google nuclear propulsion, space mining, and advancements in radiation shielding for interstellar travel. My computer returned several relevant links, including NASA's NIAC-funded studies, IAEA's report on nuclear technology for future space missions, and articles on interplanetary spaceflight, space colonization, and mining in space."
