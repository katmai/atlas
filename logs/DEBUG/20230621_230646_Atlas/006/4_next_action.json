        "text": "After reviewing the search results, I have found that one potential advancement in technology that could make interstellar travel more feasible is the development of advanced propulsion systems. There are several types of advanced propulsion systems that have been proposed, including nuclear fusion and antimatter propulsion. While these technologies are still in the early stages of development, they have the potential to significantly increase the speed and efficiency of interstellar travel. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome, such as the energy requirements and the safety concerns associated with these technologies. I will need to conduct further research to determine the feasibility of these technologies for interstellar travel.",
