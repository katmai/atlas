"I was commanded to google nuclear propulsion for interstellar travel and found several relevant links, including NASA's NIAC-funded studies, IAEA's report on nuclear technology for future space missions, and articles on interplanetary spaceflight, space colonization, and mining in space. My computer returned a list of links related to nuclear propulsion for interstellar travel, including NASA's testing of a nuclear engine for future Mars missions, the use of nuclear technology to propel and power future space missions, and research on interstellar spaceflight using nuclear propulsion and advanced techniques."
