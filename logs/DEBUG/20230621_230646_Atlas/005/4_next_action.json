        "text": "After reviewing the search results, I have found that the concept of a \"warp drive\" could potentially make interstellar travel more feasible. A warp drive is a hypothetical propulsion system that could allow a spacecraft to travel faster than the speed of light by warping space-time. While the concept of a warp drive is still purely theoretical, there has been some research into the possibility of developing such a technology. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome, such as the energy requirements and the potential negative effects on the fabric of space-time. I will need to conduct further research to determine the feasibility of a warp drive for interstellar travel.",
