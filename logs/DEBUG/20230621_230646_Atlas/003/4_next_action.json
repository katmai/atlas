        "text": "After reviewing the search results, I have found that nuclear propulsion is a promising technology for interstellar travel. Nuclear propulsion could provide the necessary speed to travel to other star systems in a reasonable amount of time. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome, such as developing a nuclear reactor that is safe and reliable for use in space. I will need to conduct further research to determine the feasibility of nuclear propulsion for interstellar travel.",
