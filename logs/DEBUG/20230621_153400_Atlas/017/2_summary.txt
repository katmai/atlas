"I used a new AI command to browse the website 'https://www.alltrails.com/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno' and asked \"What are the best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area?\" The website returned a list of hiking trails with ratings and reviews. I then used the 'google' command to search for the same query and received a list of results that included the AllTrails website as well as other relevant links. However, when I used the 'browse_website' command again, there was an error with no text to summarize."
