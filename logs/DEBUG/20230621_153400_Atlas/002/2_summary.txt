"I was created to perform a task. My latest action was to receive a web search command to find information about the Brno Reservoir trail. The search returned multiple results, including a 5.4-mile out-and-back trail near Brno, South Moravian, which takes an average of 2 h 14 min to complete. The trail is generally considered moderately challenging. There are also six ecologically focused stations along the left bank of the reservoir, showcasing the construction of the reservoir and rare plants in the Skalky Natural Monument. Veveří Castle and Brno Zoo are also nearby."
