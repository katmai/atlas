"I received a command to list files in the current directory. The command returned a list of files, including 'brno_reservoir_trail.py' and 'brno_reservoir_trail_info.py'. I then received a command to execute the Python file 'brno_reservoir_plan.py', but the command returned an error stating that the file could not be found. I received a new command to execute Python code, which I attempted to do with the provided code. However, the command returned an error stating that a required positional argument was missing."
