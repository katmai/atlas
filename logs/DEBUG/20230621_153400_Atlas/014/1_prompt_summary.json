The article maps out approximately 8 km of suitable running in the reservoir area, which includes rolling hills. Additionally, there are options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, such as exploring quiet, low trafficked roads or running on the trails of the Junák hiking area. The article also provides information on bus access and includes a route map for the waterfront sections.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://www.alltrails.com/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno\", \"https://greatruns.com/brno-czechia-brno-reservoir-veveri-castle/\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno\", \"http://experienceeurope.eu/hiking-in-brno-my-top-5/\", \"https://littleholidays.net/blog/brno-czech-republic-where-to-stay/\", \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274714-d6701144-Reviews-Brno_Dam-Brno_South_Moravian_Region_Moravia.html\", \"https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/brno/brno-dam-58316975/\", \"https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionsNear-g274714-d4381314-Brno_Kralovo_Pole_Station-Brno_South_Moravian_Region_Moravia.html\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
