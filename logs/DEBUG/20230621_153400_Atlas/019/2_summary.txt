"I used the 'web_search' command to search for the best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area, but the website returned no results. I then used the 'google' command and received a list of relevant links, including the AllTrails website. I used the 'browse_website' command again, but there was an error with no text to summarize. I used the 'browse_website' command with the link from the Great Runs website and found that there are no loop trails around the entire reservoir, but there are some sections of waterfront path or roadside sidewalk. The article maps out an 8 km route in the reservoir area, which includes rolling hills. Additionally, there are a couple of decent options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, located a few km west of the reservoir. The article also mentions bus access to the area. However, it does not provide information on hiking trails or the best hiking trails in the area."
