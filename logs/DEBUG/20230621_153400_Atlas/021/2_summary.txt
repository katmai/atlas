"I used the 'web_search' command to search for the best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area on a different website. The 'web_search' command returned several websites with information about the best hiking trails in the area, including the AllTrails website. I used the 'browse_website' command to browse the AllTrails website to find the best hiking trails in the area, but there was an error with no text to summarize."
