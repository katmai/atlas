I then used the 'google' command and received a list of relevant links, including the AllTrails website. I used the 'browse_website' command again, but there was an error with no text to summarize. I used the 'browse_website' command with the link from the Great Runs website and found that there are no loop trails around the entire reservoir, but there are some sections of waterfront path or roadside sidewalk. The article maps out an 8 km route in the reservoir area, which includes rolling hills. Additionally, there are a couple of decent options for running near the 13th-century Veveří Castle, located a few km west of the reservoir. The article also mentions bus access to the area. However, it does not provide information on hiking trails or the best hiking trails in the area.\n\nThe 'browse_website' command did not provide information on the best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area. I executed the 'google' command again with a more specific query to find more relevant websites. The 'google' command returned several websites with information about the best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area. I then used the 'browse_website' command to browse the AllTrails website to find the best hiking trails in the area, but there was an error with no text to summarize. I then used the 'web_search' command to look for the best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area on a different website, which may have more relevant information.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='assistant', content='{\\n    \"thoughts\": {\\n        \"text\": \"I will use the \\'web_search\\' command to look for the best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area on a different website, which may have more relevant information.\",\\n        \"reasoning\": \"The \\'browse_website\\' command did not provide information on the best hiking trails in the Brno Reservoir area.
