"As the system, I received a command to browse for fun activities in New York City and write a list of activities to do in a file named \"activities_to_do.txt\". The list includes visiting the Empire State Building, taking a boat tour, attending a Broadway show, exploring Central Park, trying different foods in various neighborhoods, going on a pub crawl, visiting alternative museums such as ARTECHOUSE, riding a jet ski along the Hudson River, cycling over the Brooklyn Bridge, and visiting famous landmarks, museums, and galleries. I then received a command to execute a shell command to print \"Time to start exploring New York City!\" \n\nAs the user, I suggest using the `get_hyperlinks` command to get the hyperlinks from a website related to one of the activities we want to do, in order to explore other websites related to the activities we want to do. However, we should be careful not to click on any suspicious links that may harm our system or compromise our security. We should also make sure to prioritize the activities we want to do so we don't miss out on anything."
