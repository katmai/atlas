Then, I received a command to browse a specific website and gather information about fun activities in New York City. I used the command to browse the website and found that there are many fun activities to do in New York City, including visiting famous landmarks, museums, and galleries, taking boat tours, attending Broadway shows, exploring Central Park, trying different foods in various neighborhoods, going on a pub crawl, and visiting alternative museums such as ARTECHOUSE. Outdoor activities such as riding a jet ski along the Hudson River and cycling over the Brooklyn Bridge are also suggested. The website also recommends staying at mid-range chain hotels or renting an apartment in neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Bushwick, and Harlem, as well as exploring other destinations in the Northeastern U.S. that can be easily reached from New York City. \\n\\nI received a command to write a list of activities to do in New York City to a file named \"activities_to_do.txt\".
