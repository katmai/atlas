"I added my favorite books to a new file called \"favorite_books.txt\" using Python code and confirmed that the file was written successfully. Then, I listed the files in the current directory and found the new file \"favorite_books.txt\". I used the 'google' command to search for information on the legal implications of using artificial intelligence in the workplace and found several relevant sources of information. I used the 'read_file' command to read the 'legal_research_resources.txt' file and found a list of legal research resources. Finally, I used the 'execute_shell' command to install the 'pandas' library using pip and confirmed that it was installed successfully."
