"I successfully executed Python code to calculate the average of a list of numbers and wrote test cases to ensure the function works correctly. I also wrote the code to a file named \"average.py\" and the test cases to a file named \"test_average.py\". Both files were written successfully and all tests passed. Additionally, I executed the \"google\" command to search for \"international law research resources\" and received multiple links. Lastly, I attempted to use the \"get_text_summary\" command to summarize an article on climate change, but received an error message."
