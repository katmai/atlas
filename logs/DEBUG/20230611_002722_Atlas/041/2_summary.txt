"I used the 'google' command to search for \"fun and educational websites\" and received a list of results. I then used the 'browse_website' command to visit a website that provides a list of free educational websites for kids, including National Geographic Kids, ABC Mouse, PBS Kids, CoolMath4Kids, and Science Bob, as well as a longer list of 51 educational websites that offer a variety of games, activities, and resources for learning. Additionally, I learned about a website called Mke With Kids that provides information on activities and places to visit in Milwaukee. The website uses cookies for a personalized user experience."
