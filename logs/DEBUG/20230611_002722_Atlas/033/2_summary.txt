"I received a command from the AI to Google the legal implications of using artificial intelligence in the workplace. Then, I executed Python code to find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 100 and listed the files in the current directory. Afterwards, I read the \"legal_research_resources.txt\" file and found a list of legal research resources from various sources, including Harvard Law School Library, Texas State Law Library, and the United Nations."
