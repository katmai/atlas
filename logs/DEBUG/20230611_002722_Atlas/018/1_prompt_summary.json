Then, I executed the \"browse_website\" command to search for the standard of proof in a personal injury case, but the website did not provide the information. Next, I executed the \"google\" command to search for \"international law research resources\". After that, I wrote the \"average.py\" file using the \"write_to_file\" command and received the message \"File written to successfully.\" The file contains the \"calculate_average\" function. Then, I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command on \"average.py\" and received the message \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". Finally, I wrote a test file \"test_average.py\" using the \"write_to_file\" command and received the message \"File written to successfully.\" The test file contains 3 test cases for the \"calculate_average\" function from the \"average\" module. All tests passed and the message \"All tests passed!\" was printed when I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command on \"test_average.py\".\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"international law research resources\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://law.gwu.libguides.com/PIL\", \"https://uow.libguides.com/law/international-law-resources\", \"https://research.un.org/az.php?s=1520\", \"https://guides.library.harvard.edu/law/fi-free\", \"https://www.law.nyu.edu/global/researchtools\", \"https://www.loc.gov/research-centers/law-library-of-congress/collections/digital-collections/foreign-law/\", \"https://www.law.nyu.edu/library/research/researchguides\", \"https://libguides.law.rutgers.edu/internationallaw\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
