Then, I used the \"google\" command to search for legal research resources and received a list of websites from my computer. My computer returned an answer from the Harvard Law School website which provided a guide to free legal research resources in the United States, including federal and state law, treaties, case law, court documents, executive documents, secondary sources, and data sources. The guide emphasized the importance of combining paid and free resources for effective legal research and provided links to various online sources. It also suggested visiting local law libraries for additional resources and tools such as citators for case validation.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"write_to_file\", \"args\": {\"filename\": \"legal_research_resources.txt\", \"text\": \"Notes on Legal Research Resources:\\\\n\\\\n- Harvard Law School Library guide on free legal research: https://guides.library.harvard.edu/law/free\\\\n- Texas State Law Library guide on legal research for beginners: https://guides.sll.texas.gov/legal-research-for-beginners\\\\n- George Mason University Law Library list of free legal research resources: https://www.law.gmu.edu/library/freelegalresearch\\\\n- Bloomberg Law\\'s Complete Legal Research Resource: https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/the-complete-legal-research-resource/\\\\n- Clio\\'s list of best free legal research tools: https://www.clio.com/blog/best-free-legal-research-tools/\\\\n- Alaska Court System\\'s legal research page: https://courts.alaska.gov/library/aklegal.htm\\\\n- United Nations\\' legal research guide: https://research.un.org/en/legal\\\\n- LexisNexis\\'s list of best free legal research tools: https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/insights/legal/b/thought-leadership/posts/best-free-legal-research-tools\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
