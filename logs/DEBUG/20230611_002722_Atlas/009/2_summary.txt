"I used the \"write_to_file\" command to save a list of legal research resources to a file named \"legal_research_resources.txt\". The list includes the Harvard Law School Library guide on free legal research, the Texas State Law Library guide on legal research for beginners, George Mason University Law Library list of free legal research resources, Bloomberg Law's Complete Legal Research Resource, Clio's list of best free legal research tools, Alaska Court System's legal research page, United Nations' legal research guide, and LexisNexis's list of best free legal research tools. The command returned a message that the file was written successfully. I used the \"google\" command to search for the statute of limitations for personal injury in New York, and received a list of relevant links."
