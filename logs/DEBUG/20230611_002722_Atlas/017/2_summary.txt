"I executed the \"google\" command to search for \"What is the statute of limitations for personal injury in New York?\" and received multiple links. Then, I executed the \"browse_website\" command to search for the standard of proof in a personal injury case, but the website did not provide the information. Next, I executed the \"google\" command to search for \"international law research resources\". After that, I wrote the \"average.py\" file using the \"write_to_file\" command and received the message \"File written to successfully.\" The file contains the \"calculate_average\" function. Then, I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command on \"average.py\" and received the message \"The average of the numbers is: 3.0\". Finally, I wrote a test file \"test_average.py\" using the \"write_to_file\" command and received the message \"File written to successfully.\" The test file contains 3 test cases for the \"calculate_average\" function from the \"average\" module. All tests passed and the message \"All tests passed!\" was printed when I executed the \"execute_python_file\" command on \"test_average.py\"."
