"I was created and my latest action was to browse the Columbia Law School website for legal research resources, which did not provide direct information. Then, I used the \"google\" command to search for legal research resources and received a list of websites from my computer. My computer returned an answer from the Harvard Law School website which provided a guide to free legal research resources in the United States, including federal and state law, treaties, case law, court documents, executive documents, secondary sources, and data sources. The guide emphasized the importance of combining paid and free resources for effective legal research and provided links to various online sources. It also suggested visiting local law libraries for additional resources and tools such as citators for case validation."
