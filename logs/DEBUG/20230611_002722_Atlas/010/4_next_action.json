        "reasoning": "As an LLM student interested in legal technology, it is important for me to be able to write basic Python scripts to automate legal tasks. By writing a script to calculate the average of a list of numbers, I can practice my Python skills and learn more about how to use Python to automate legal tasks.",

        "criticism": "I need to make sure that the script is well-written and free of errors before I run it, and that I am using best practices for writing Python code.",
