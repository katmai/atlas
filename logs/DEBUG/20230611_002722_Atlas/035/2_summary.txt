"I googled the legal implications of using artificial intelligence in the workplace and found various sources including the American Bar Association, Harvard Law School Library, and the United Nations. I executed Python code to find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 100 and listed the files in the current directory. I read the \"legal_research_resources.txt\" file and found a list of legal research resources from multiple sources, including Texas State Law Library and Bloomberg Law's Complete Legal Research Resource. Then, I listed the files in the current directory again and found a new file \"factorial.py\". I executed Python code to find the factorial of 5 and saved it as \"factorial.py\"."
