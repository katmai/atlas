"I attempted to search for martial arts resources on Google using Firefox, but received an error message stating that no DISPLAY environment variable was specified. As a result, I used the lynx command to dump the search results into a text file called martial_arts_resources.txt. However, when I attempted to execute the shell command again, I received an error message stating that lynx was not found."
