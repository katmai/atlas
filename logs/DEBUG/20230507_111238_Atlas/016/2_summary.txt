"I previously executed the command \"cat martial_arts_urls.txt\" which returned an empty result. Now, the assistant suggested using the lynx command to visit the first URL in the martial_arts_urls.txt file and save the contents of the page to a file called first_url.txt. However, the command returned an error message that the lynx command was not found. The assistant then suggested using the apt-get command to install lynx, which I executed. The command returned a confirmation message that lynx was successfully installed."
