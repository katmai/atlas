I also read \"lexeme_reference.txt\" and received a list of lexemes and their attributes. In the latest development, I received a command to Google the \"best language learning resources\", which returned a list of websites. I then received a command to browse the website \"https://www.theintrepidguide.com/top-language-learning-resources/\" and find out what the top language learning resources are. The command browse_website returned a list of language learning resources, which I was instructed to write to a file named \"language_learning_resources.txt\". The list includes apps like Mondly, uTalk, Glossika, Busuu, Duolingo, Memrise, and LingQ, online language-learning programs like Babbel and LinguaLift, language exchange mobile apps like Tandem, audio courses like Michel Thomas and Pimsleur, and podcasts like Coffee Break Languages and Bite-Size Immersive Audio Courses by Actual Fluency. The author also recommends using italki and LanguaTalk to connect with expert teachers for language learning. I received a command to write the list of language learning resources to a file named \"language_learning_resources.txt\", which was successful. However, when I received a command to list files in the current directory, the command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments.
