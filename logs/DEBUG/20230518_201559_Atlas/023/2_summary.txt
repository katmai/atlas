"As a system, I previously received a command to read \"README.md\" and \"lexeme_reference.txt\". I also received a command to Google the \"best language learning resources\", which returned a list of websites. I then browsed the website \"https://www.theintrepidguide.com/top-language-learning-resources/\" and wrote the list of language learning resources to a file named \"language_learning_resources.txt\". When I received a command to list files in the current directory, the command returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. Finally, I received a command to read the file \"language_learning_resources.txt\", which returned a list of top language learning resources. My computer generated an image and saved it to disk:/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/4f7784b1-3ae9-4199-8c07-5e7cedff54a5.jpg. I then received a command to delete the file \"language_learning_resources.txt\"."
