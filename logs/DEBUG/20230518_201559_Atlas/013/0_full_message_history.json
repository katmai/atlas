The model marries psycholinguistic theory with modern machine learning techniques, indirectly estimating the \"half-life\" of words (and potentially any other item or fact) in a student's long-term memory.\n\nThis repository contains a public release of the data and code used for several experiments in the following paper (which introduces HLR):\n\n> B. Settles and B. Meeder. 2016. [A Trainable Spaced Repetition Model for Language Learning](settles.acl16.pdf).\n> In _Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)_, pages 1848-1858.\n\nWhen using this data set and/or software, please cite this publication. A BibTeX record is:\n\n```\n@inproceedings{settles.acl16,\n    Author = {B. Settles and B. Meeder},\n    Booktitle = {Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)},\n    Pages = {1848--1858},\n    Publisher = {ACL},\n    Title = {A Trainable Spaced Repetition Model for Language Learning},\n    Year = {2016}\n    DOI = {10.18653/v1/P16-1174},\n    URL = {http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1174}\n}\n```\n\n\n## Software\n\nThe file ``experiment.py`` contains a Python implementation of half-life regression, as well as several baseline spaced repetition algorithms used in Section 4.1 of the paper above. It is implemented in pure Python, and we recommend using [pypy](http://pypy.org/) on large data sets for efficiency. The software creates the subfolder ``results/`` for outputting model predictions on the test partition and induced model weights for inspection.\n\nThe file ``evaluation.r`` implements an R function, ``sr_evaluate()``, which takes a prediction file from the script above and implements the three metrics we use for evaluation: mean absolute error (MAE), area under the ROC curve (AUC), and Spearman correlation for estimated half-life. Significance tests are also included.\n\n\n## Data Set and Format\n\nThe data set is available on [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/N8XJME) (361 MB). This is a gzipped CSV file containing the 13 million Duolingo student learning traces used in our experiments.\n\nThe columns are as follows:\n\n* ``p_recall`` - proportion of exercises from this lesson/practice where the word/lexeme was correctly recalled\n* ``timestamp`` - UNIX timestamp of the current lesson/practice\n* ``delta`` - time (in seconds) since the last lesson/practice that included this word/lexeme\n* ``user_id`` - student user ID who did the lesson/practice (anonymized)\n* ``learning_language`` - language being learned\n* ``ui_language`` - user interface language (presumably native to the student)\n* ``lexeme_id`` - system ID for the lexeme tag (i.e., word)\n* ``lexeme_string`` - lexeme tag (see below)\n* ``history_seen`` - total times user has seen the word/lexeme prior to this lesson/practice\n* ``history_correct`` - total times user has been correct for the word/lexeme prior to this lesson/practice\n* ``session_seen`` - times the user saw the word/lexeme during this lesson/practice\n* ``session_correct`` - times the user got the word/lexeme correct during this lesson/practice\n\nThe ``lexeme_string`` column contains a string representation of the \"lexeme tag\" used by Duolingo for each lesson/practice (data instance) in our experiments. It has been added for this release to facilitate future research and analysis. Only the ``lexeme_id`` column was used in our original experiments. The ``lexeme_string`` field uses the following format:\n\n```\nsurface-form/lemma<pos>[<modifiers>...]\n```\n\nWhere ``surface-form`` refers to the inflected form seen in (or intended for) the exercise, ``lemma`` is the uninflected root, ``pos`` is the high-level part of speech, and each of the ``modifers`` encodes a morphological component specific to the surface form (tense, gender, person, case, etc.). A few examples from Spanish:\n\n```\nbajo/bajo<pr>\nblancos/blanco<adj><m><pl>\ncarta/carta<n><f><sg>\nde/de<pr>\ndiario/diario<n><m><sg>\nellos/prpers<prn><tn><p3><m><pl>\nes/ser<vbser><pri><p3><sg>\nescribe/escribir<vblex><pri><p3><sg>\nescribimos/escribir<vblex><pri><p1><pl>\nlee/leer<vblex><pri><p3><sg>\nlees/leer<vblex><pri><p2><sg>\nleo/leer<vblex><pri><p1><sg>\nlibro/libro<n><m><sg>\nnegra/negro<adj><f><sg>\npersona/persona<n><f><sg>\npor/por<pr>\nson/ser<vbser><pri><p3><pl>\nsoy/ser<vbser><pri><p1><sg>\ny/y<cnjcoo>\n```\n\nSome tags contain wildcard components, written as ``<*...>``. For example, ``<*sf>`` refers to a \"generic\" lexeme without any specific surface form (e.g., a lexeme tag that represents _all_ conjugations of a verb: \"run,\" \"ran,\" \"running,\" etc.). The ``<*numb>`` modifier subsumes both singular and plural forms of a noun (e.g., \"teacher\" and \"teachers\"). The file ``lexeme_reference.txt`` contains a reference of pos and modifier components used for lexeme tags.\n"
