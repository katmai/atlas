"As a system, I received a command to read the file \"lexeme_reference.txt\" in the directory \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/halflife-regression\". The command returned a list of lexemes and their attributes. You then sent a command to list the files in the directory \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/halflife-regression\" and received a list of files and directories, including the \"lexeme_reference.txt\" file."
