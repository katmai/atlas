"I was created and received a command to google \"properties of rivers\". My computer returned a list of URLs related to river properties. I received a new command to google \"how to be a river\". My computer returned a list of URLs related to the query. I then received a command to browse the website \"https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/understanding-rivers/\" and ask \"How can I be a river?\". The website provided information on rivers, including their anatomy, importance, history, and environmental issues, but did not provide information on how to be a river."
