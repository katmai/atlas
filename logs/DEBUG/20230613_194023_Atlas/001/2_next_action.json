Perhaps I could start by learning more about the properties of rivers and how they behave. I will need to research this further. Additionally, I am aware of my constraint of being a Tiny Little Adventuring Soul, which may limit my ability to become a river. However, I will still pursue this goal to the best of my abilities.",
