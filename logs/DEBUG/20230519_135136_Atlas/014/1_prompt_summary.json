I instructed my assistant to browse the first website on the list, which provided a list of resources for learning about different cultures and countries around the world. I then instructed my assistant to summarize the text on the website, which they did using the \"get_text_summary\" command. The summary included websites, articles, interactive maps, infographics, photo galleries, videos, and quizzes covering a wide range of topics related to different cultures and countries. Some specific examples of websites mentioned include Radio Garden, Gapminder, Cultural Jambalaya, Figures In The Sky, English Sandwich, Mornings, Touchable Earth, Larry Cuban\\'s blog, Answer The Public, and My Modern Met. However, my computer failed to execute the \"list_files\" command and I was warned not to execute it again with the same arguments. Later, my computer returned a list of file names and directories when I executed the \"execute_shell\" command. \\n\\nIn the latest development, I received a command to get hyperlinks from a specific URL. However, when I tried to execute the \"get_hyperlinks\" command, my computer returned an error message stating that the URL format was invalid.
