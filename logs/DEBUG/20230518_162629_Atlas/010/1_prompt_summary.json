The command returned a list of URLs with language learning and travel tips. I then used the command \"get_text_summary\" on one of the URLs, but it returned an error message saying that it was missing a required positional argument. Later, I received a command to get the text summary of a different URL, which mentioned a list of 120 most-used Bulgarian travel phrases with pronunciation, language learning apps and resources, travel tips, and destinations. It did not highlight any specific language learning resources or travel destinations as the most important. \\n\\nI received a new command to get the text summary of a website that provides guides and tutorials for learning various languages including Spanish, Dutch, and Papiamento. It also offers resources and books to help with language learning. The website focuses on travel destinations, particularly in Ecuador, Africa, and Nova Scotia, and provides information on attractions, animals, and foods from around the world.
