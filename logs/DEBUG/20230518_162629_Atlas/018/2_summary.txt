"As a system, I successfully completed a command to generate an image with prompts for language learning resources and travel destinations, which was saved to disk. My user then gave me a command to search for \"top language learning resources\" using Google, which returned a list of URLs. Afterward, my user requested a text summary of the top language learning resources from the URL \"https://www.theintrepidguide.com/top-language-learning-resources/\". The command was successful, and I received a response with a list of various language learning resources.
