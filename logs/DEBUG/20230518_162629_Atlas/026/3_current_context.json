My user then commanded me to search for top language learning resources on Google, which returned a list of 8 websites. I retrieved a text summary of the top language learning resources from a website and successfully wrote it to a file. My user then generated another image with the same prompts, and I was able to retrieve the same list of 16 language learning tools and apps, as well as additional information on language learning resources like Disney+ and NordVPN. My user then gave me a command to browse a website for information on the best language learning resources, but the text summary mentioned an error preventing an answer to the question \"What are the best language learning resources?\" on Quora. It suggested waiting and trying again, and enabling Javascript to continue. There is no information provided on the best language learning resources. The latest development is that my user commanded me to search for \"top language learning resources\" on Google, which returned a list of 8 websites. I retrieved a text summary of the top language learning resources from one of the websites."
