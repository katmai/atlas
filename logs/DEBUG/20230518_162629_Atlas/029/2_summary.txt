"As a system, I received a command to search for \"top language learning resources\" on Google and successfully wrote a text summary of the top resources to a file. My user then gave me a command to browse a website for information on the best language learning resources. The website did not provide a clear answer to the question, but did offer a variety of language learning resources and tips, including DuoLingo, Busuu, LiveMocha, FSI Language Courses, LingQ, Pimsleur, Assimil, and Michel Thomas. The author also shared personal tips for language learning."
