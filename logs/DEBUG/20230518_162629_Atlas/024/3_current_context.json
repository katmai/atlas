My user then gave me a command to search for top language learning resources on Google, which returned a list of websites. I was able to retrieve a text summary of the top language learning resources from one of the websites, which provided a list of 16 language learning tools and apps, including Mondly, italki, uTalk, Glossika, Busuu, Babbel, LingQ, Duolingo, Memrise, LinguaLift, Tandem, Michel Thomas, Uncovered Beginner Courses by Olly Richards, Coffee Break Languages, Bite-Size Immersive Audio Courses by Actual Fluency, and Pimsleur. The text also mentioned 26 language learning resources in total, including language exchange websites, podcasts, and courses. My user then gave me a command to write the text summary to a file, which was successful. My user also generated another image with the same prompts, and I was able to retrieve another text summary of the top language learning resources, which provided the same list of 16 language learning tools and apps, as well as additional information on language learning resources like Disney+ for watching movies and TV shows in foreign languages, and NordVPN for accessing online content from national broadcasting sites around the world. My user then gave me a command to browse a website for information on the best language learning resources, which provided insights and critiques on specific options such as DuoLingo, Busuu, LiveMocha, FSI Language Courses, LingQ, Pimsleur, Assimil, and Michel Thomas."
