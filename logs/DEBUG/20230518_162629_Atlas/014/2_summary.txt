"As a system, I received a command to write the information from the TripAdvisor website to a file named \"south_africa_activities.txt\". My user then received a message that the file was written successfully. My user also gave me a new command to generate an image with a prompt for top language learning resources and travel destinations, including Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, Babbel, Pimsleur, and Memrise for language learning resources and South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Tanzania, and Kenya for travel destinations."
