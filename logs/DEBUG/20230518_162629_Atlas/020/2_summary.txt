"As a system, I received a command to retrieve a text summary of the best online apps and courses to learn a new language, but the text did not provide a clear list of resources. Instead, it offered reviews and recommendations for various language learning resources, including apps, courses, podcasts, and exchange programs, for a wide range of languages. My user then gave me a command to generate an image with prompts for language learning resources and travel destinations, which was successfully completed and saved to disk. The prompts included Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, Babbel, Pimsleur, and Memrise for language learning resources, and South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Tanzania, and Kenya for travel destinations."
