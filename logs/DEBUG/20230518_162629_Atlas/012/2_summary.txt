"As a system, I received a command to browse a website for information on top attractions and activities in Africa. However, the website did not provide any relevant information. I then received a command from you to use Google to search for this information. The search returned several websites including TripAdvisor, Africa Wanderlust, and Touropia, among others. You then gave me a command to get a text summary from the TripAdvisor website for the question \"What are the top attractions and activities to do in South Africa?\" using the URL https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293740-Activities-South_Africa.html."
