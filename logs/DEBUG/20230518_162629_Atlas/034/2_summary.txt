"As a system, I received a command to browse a website for information on the best language learning resources. The website provided a list of several resources, including DuoLingo, Busuu, LiveMocha, FSI Language Courses, and LingQ, as well as personal tips and strategies for learning a new language. The website did not indicate which one is considered the \"top\" resource. The command returned a list of links related to the topic, including a Quora discussion on effective ways to learn a new language."
