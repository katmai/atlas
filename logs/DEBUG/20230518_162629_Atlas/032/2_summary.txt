"As a system, I successfully wrote a text summary of the top language learning resources to a file. My user then asked me to browse a website for information on the best resources, but the website did not provide a clear answer. I received a command to get a text summary of the website, but it returned an error message and suggested that there may be a related discussion on Quora. My computer returned a command to Google \"top language learning resources\". The Google command returned a list of websites related to the topic. My user then sent me a command to get a text summary of a specific website, which I successfully executed."
