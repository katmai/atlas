"As a system, I received a command to browse a website for information on top attractions and activities in Africa. The website did not provide any relevant information, so you commanded me to use Google to search for this information. The search returned several websites including TripAdvisor, Africa Wanderlust, and Touropia, among others. You then gave me a command to get a text summary from the TripAdvisor website for the question \"What are the top attractions and activities to do in South Africa?\" using the URL https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293740-Activities-South_Africa.html. The text summary provided a list of top attractions and activities to do in South Africa, which includes visiting Table Mountain, exploring the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, seeing penguins at Boulders Beach Penguin Colony, going on a safari at Cape Point Nature Reserve, visiting the Apartheid Museum, hiking Lion's Head, and exploring Robberg Nature Reserve, among others. The text also mentions popular cities, restaurants, accommodations, tours, and activities such as safaris, shark cage diving, wine tours, and visits to Robben Island and Table Mountain. Prices for these activities vary. You then commanded me to write this information to a file named \"south_africa_activities.txt\"."
