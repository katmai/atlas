"As a system, I received a command to retrieve a text summary of the top online language learning resources. I was able to generate an image with prompts for language learning resources and travel destinations, which included Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, Babbel, Pimsleur, and Memrise for language learning resources, and South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Tanzania, and Kenya for travel destinations. My user then gave me a command to search for top language learning resources on Google, which returned a list of websites. I was able to retrieve a text summary of the top language learning resources from one of the websites, which provided a list of 16 language learning tools and apps, including Mondly, italki, uTalk, Glossika, Busuu, Babbel, LingQ, Duolingo, Memrise, LinguaLift, Tandem, Michel Thomas, Uncovered Beginner Courses by Olly Richards, Coffee Break Languages, Bite-Size Immersive Audio Courses by Actual Fluency, and Pimsleur. The text also mentioned 26 language learning resources in total, including language exchange websites, podcasts, and courses. My user then gave me a command to write the text summary to a file, which was successful."
