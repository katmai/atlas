"As a system, I received a command to Google language learning resources and travel destinations. The command returned a list of URLs with language learning and travel tips. I then used the command \"get_text_summary\" on one of the URLs, but it returned an error message saying that it was missing a required positional argument. The command I used was: {\"name\": \"get_text_summary\", \"args\": {\"url\": \"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/120-mostused-bulgarian-travel-phrases-you-need-to-know-plus-audio--78109374774535124/\", \"question\": \"What are the most important language learning resources and travel destinations mentioned on this website?\"}}."
