"I used the 'execute_shell' command to check the current working directory and confirmed that we are in the correct directory. Then, I used the 'list_files' command to confirm if the file 'my_river_poem.txt' exists. The file was not found, so I can use the 'write_to_file' command to create a file named 'my_river_poem.txt' and write the contents of the poem to it."
