"I attempted to execute the 'rock_simulation.py' script using the 'execute_python_file' command, but it returned an error due to a keyboard interrupt. I then used the 'list_files' command to confirm the files in the directory, which returned a list including 'my_river_poem.txt'. The 'list_files' command also returned a list of all the files in the directory."
