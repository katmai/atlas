We can do some research on this topic and then perhaps write a short essay or poem about it. This will also give us a chance to practice using the 'browse_website' and 'write_to_file' commands.",
        "reasoning": "Starting with a simple and fun task will help us get into the groove of things and also give us a chance to practice using some of the commands. Additionally, exploring the topic of what it means to be a rock may inspire us to come up with some creative ideas for our poem or essay.",
