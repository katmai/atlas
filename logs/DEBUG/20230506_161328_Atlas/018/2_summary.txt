"I received an HTTP 404 error message when using the \"get_text_summary\" command to search for the meaning of being a rock on the website \"https://www.learner.org/series/rocks-and-minerals/\" with the question \"What does it mean to be a rock?\". I executed a shell command to search for the answer on Google and extracted the first result using grep and sed. The command returned an empty STDOUT and STDERR."
