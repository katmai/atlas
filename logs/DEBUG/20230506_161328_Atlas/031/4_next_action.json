I will use the 'execute_python_file' command to run a Python script that will simulate being a rock for a period of time. While the script is running, I will take a break and come back with a fresh perspective. I will also use the 'list_files' command to confirm that the 'my_river_poem.txt' file still exists in the directory.",

Taking a break will help me come back with a fresh mind and renewed energy. Checking the 'my_river_poem.txt' file will ensure that it still exists and has not been accidentally deleted.",
