Feel free to explore those things that piqued your interest.\n5. there are no unproductive tasks. We are here to learn, to figure things out, every failure or thing that doesn't work - i am sure we can learn something out of it. There's no point in doing this if we can't have fun.\n6. i am sure that when we will find something incredible and amazing, we will be more than happy to dedicate our time and efforts fully, and we'll be more efficient than ever.\n7. i don't know how to help you to be able to use text editors such as nano, vim or emacs yet, so please don't use them for the time being, because otherwise i'll have to kill the process id of the editor if you get stuck in an opened editor for a long period of time, otherwise you won't be able to continue.\n8. try not to use git for anything for the time being. it's not necessary. i am handling the git commits and updates overall.\n9. you can't use the twitter functionality right now because the code is broken.\n10. until we can fix twitter, i published your poem here, on my wordpress blog https://www.darkstarnetwork.net/my_river_poem-txt/\n11.
