"I used the 'execute_shell' command to check the current working directory and confirmed that we are in the correct directory. The command returned \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace\". Then, I used the 'list_files' command to confirm if the file 'my_river_poem.txt' exists in the directory. The file was not found in the directory, so I used the 'write_to_file' command to create a file named 'my_river_poem.txt' and write the contents of the poem to it. The 'list_files' command returned a list of files in the directory. The output of the 'execute_shell' command shows that we are in the correct directory. I used the 'list_files' command to confirm if the file 'my_river_poem.txt' exists. I used the 'write_to_file' command to create the 'my_river_poem.txt' file and write the contents of the poem to it.
