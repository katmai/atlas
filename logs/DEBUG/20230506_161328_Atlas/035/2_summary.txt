"I used the \\'write_to_file\\' command to create a Python script named \\'rock_simulation.py\\' that will simulate being a rock for a period of time. I used the \\'list_files\\' command to confirm that the script was created successfully and that the \\'my_river_poem.txt\\' file still exists in the directory. The \\'list_files\\' command confirmed that both files exist. Nothing new happened."
