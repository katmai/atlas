"I attempted to read a file named \"output.txt\" but received an error saying the file does not exist. I then executed a shell command to search for the answer to \"What does it mean to be a rock?\" on Google, extracted the first result using grep and sed, and redirected the output to a file named \"output.txt.\" Nothing new happened."
