"I used command \"analyze_code\" and received a warning to avoid using <script> tags in non-JavaScript files. Then, I used command \"browse_website\" to visit https://www.learner.org/series/rocks-and-minerals/ and asked \"What does it mean to be a rock?\". The website returned a message from Annenberg Learner about their website and resources for educators, but did not provide an answer to my question."
