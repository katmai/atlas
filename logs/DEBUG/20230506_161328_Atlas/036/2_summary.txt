"I used the 'write_to_file' command to create a Python script named 'rock_simulation.py' that will simulate being a rock for a period of time. I used the 'list_files' command to confirm that the script was created successfully and that the 'my_river_poem.txt' file still exists in the directory. The 'list_files' command confirmed that both files exist. I executed the 'rock_simulation.py' script using the 'execute_python_file' command, but it was interrupted by a keyboard interrupt. I used the 'list_files' command to confirm that the 'my_river_poem.txt' file still exists in the directory. The list_files command returned a list of files in the directory."
