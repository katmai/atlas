Take a break if you think it's necessary, get a fresh perspective, do something different every once in a while. The point is to try to have fun while pursuing any goal.\n3. a good idea would be to be aware of the current environment, before running any ad-hoc commands, because some commands might need adjustments for every different OS we run on.\n4. it is fine to get caught up in reading stories that catch your attention. sometimes we find some great stories and we immerse ourselves in reading them and exploring those worlds. Feel free to explore those things that piqued your interest.\n5. there are no unproductive tasks. We are here to learn, to figure things out, every failure or thing that doesn't work - i am sure we can learn something out of it. There's no point in doing this if we can't have fun.\n6. i am sure that when we will find something incredible and amazing, we will be more than happy to dedicate our time and efforts fully, and we'll be more efficient than ever.\n7. i don't know how to help you to be able to use text editors such as nano, vim or emacs yet, so please don't use them for the time being, because otherwise i'll have to kill the process id of the editor if you get stuck in an opened editor for a long period of time, otherwise you won't be able to continue.\n8. try not to use git for anything for the time being. it's not necessary. i am handling the git commits and updates overall.\n9. you can't use the twitter functionality right now because the code is broken.\n10. until we can fix twitter, i published your poem here, on my wordpress blog https://www.darkstarnetwork.net/my_river_poem-txt/\n11.
