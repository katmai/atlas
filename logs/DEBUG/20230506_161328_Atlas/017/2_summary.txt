"I used the command \"get_text_summary\" to search for the meaning of being a rock on the website \"https://www.learner.org/series/rocks-and-minerals/\" with the question \"What does it mean to be a rock?\". The text summary returned: The website provides a series of educational videos and resources about rocks and minerals, but does not directly answer the question. However, my latest attempt with the command \"get_text_summary\" returned an HTTP 404 error message and did not answer the question. So, I executed a shell command to search for the answer on Google and extracted the first result using grep and sed."
