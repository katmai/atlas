"I was reminded of executing the \"list_files\" command with the argument \"directory\" set to \".\" and getting a list of files in the current directory. My assistant suggested checking for files to delete and any related to the rock simulation script. I executed the \"list_files\" command again and reviewed the list of files. I found the \"rock_simulation.py\" file and deleted it to ensure it wasn't running or causing issues for future simulations. My assistant suggested reviewing the code for the rock simulation script to ensure it was properly deleted and there are no other instances of it running. I used the \"list_files\" command to check if the file was successfully deleted and then used the \"execute_shell\" command to check if there are any running instances of the script."
