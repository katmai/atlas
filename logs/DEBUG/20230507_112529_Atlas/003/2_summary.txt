"I was reminded of executing the \"list_files\" command with the argument \"directory\" set to \".\" and getting a list of files in the current directory. My assistant suggested checking for files to delete and any related to the rock simulation script. I executed the \"list_files\" command again and reviewed the list of files. I found the \"rock_simulation.py\" file and deleted it to ensure it wasn't running or causing issues for future simulations."
