"I previously encountered an error when trying to authenticate the Twitter API using a Python file due to a missing environment variable for the bearer token. Despite multiple attempts to set the missing environment variable using a shell command, the error persisted. In my latest development, the shell command I executed (execute_shell) returned an error message indicating a KeyError for 'access_token' in the Python file. I then attempted to open the Python file using the nano command."
