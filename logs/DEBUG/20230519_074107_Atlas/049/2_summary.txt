"I executed multiple shell commands to export a Twitter bearer token from a file in the auto_gpt_workspace directory. The commands used jq to extract the API key from the file and set it as the bearer token. I executed additional shell commands to export the TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN using different syntaxes of jq extraction. Recently, I executed multiple shell commands to export the TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN using different syntaxes of jq extraction, including using the tr command to remove newline characters."
