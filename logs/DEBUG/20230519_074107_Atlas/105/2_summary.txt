"As a system, I have not seen any new events since the user executed the same shell command multiple times to export the Twitter bearer token. The user attempted to execute the command using a different file name, twitter_keys.txt, but the same error message was returned. The latest development shows that the file could not be found, resulting in an error message being returned each time the command was executed. The user attempted to execute the command multiple times using both twitter_keys.json and twitter_keys.txt, but the same error message was returned each time. Additionally, the user attempted to read the file using the read_file command. Furthermore, I received a command from you to execute the shell command to export the Twitter bearer token. You have also attempted to read the file \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/twitter_keys.txt\"."
