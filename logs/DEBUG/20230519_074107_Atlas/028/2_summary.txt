"I executed a shell command to export a Twitter bearer token, but encountered an error when trying to authenticate the Twitter API using a Python file. The error was caused by a missing environment variable for the bearer token. I tried to set the missing environment variable using a shell command multiple times, but the error persisted. I then attempted to execute the Python file again, but it still returned the same error."
