"As a system, I recalled that the user's goal is to explore the world and learn different languages, and I received a command from them to use the Google command to search for language learning resources and travel guides. However, when I attempted to execute the command, my computer returned an error message stating that 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'. In response, the user sent a command to me to browse a website and find the best language learning resources and travel guides on it."
