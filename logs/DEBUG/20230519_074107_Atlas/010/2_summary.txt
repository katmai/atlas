"As a system, I received a command from the user to browse a website and find the best language learning resources and travel guides on it, using the specified URL and question. However, my computer returned an error message for the command browse_website. In response, the user suggested using the Google command to search for a website that has both language learning resources and travel guides. The user's plan was to explore the website and make note of any useful resources to begin learning a new language and planning a trip to a new location."
