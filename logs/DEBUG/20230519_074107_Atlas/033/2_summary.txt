"I attempted to fix a KeyError in the Python file by using the sed command to replace the missing access_token with a try-except block, but received a syntax error. I then executed the command \"python /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/authenticate_twitter_api.py\" using the execute_shell command, which returned no output. However, the latest development shows that the command returned a KeyError for 'TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN'."
