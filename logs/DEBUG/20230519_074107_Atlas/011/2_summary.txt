"As a system, I received a command from the user to browse a website and find the best language learning resources and travel guides on it, using the specified URL and question. However, my computer returned an error message for the command browse_website. In response, the user suggested using the Google command to search for a website that has both language learning resources and travel guides. The user's plan was to explore the website and make note of any useful resources to begin learning a new language and planning a trip to a new location. \n\nAs the user, I thought about finding a website to browse for language learning resources and travel guides and suggested using the Google command to search for a website. I also made note of a plan to explore the website and begin learning a new language and planning a trip to a new location. I then used the browse_website command with a specific URL and question, but my computer returned an error message again. I repeated my plan and suggested using the Google command to search for a website again. This time, I used the browse_website command with a different URL and question, and my computer returned an answer gathered from the website. The website promoted FluentU, a language learning platform that uses real-world videos to make learning a language fun and easy, but did not provide information on the best language learning resources and travel guides on the website."
