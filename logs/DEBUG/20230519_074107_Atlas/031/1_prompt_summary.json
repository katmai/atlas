Despite multiple attempts to set the missing environment variable using a shell command, the error persisted. The shell command I executed returned an error message indicating a KeyError for 'access_token' in the Python file. I then attempted to open the Python file using the nano command, but it was not found. To fix the KeyError, I used the sed command to replace the missing access_token with a try-except block in the Python file.\"}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT:\\nb\\'\\'\\nSTDERR:\\nb\\'/bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: \"(\" unexpected\\\\n\\''}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"sed -i \\'s|bearer_token = bearer_token_response.json()[\\\\\"access_token\\\\\"]|try:\\\\\\\\n    bearer_token = bearer_token_response.json()[\\\\\"access_token\\\\\"]\\\\\\\\nexcept KeyError:\\\\\\\\n    print(\\\\\"Error: Could not find access_token key in response.\\\\\")\\\\\\\\n    exit(1)\\\\\\\\n|g\\' /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/authenticate_twitter_api.py\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"
