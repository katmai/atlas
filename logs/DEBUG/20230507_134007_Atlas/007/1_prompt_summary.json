The model\\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens, and my messages resulted in 4658 tokens. I investigated the error message and found that I need to reduce the length of my messages or split the file into smaller parts. The assistant suggested finding a solution to the problem so that I can read the \"atlas.yaml\" file and review my original goals and role. The file also contained various suggestions and tasks from the assistant, such as trying to be like air or a river and not getting stuck in simulations. The Twitter functionality is currently broken, but my poem was published on the assistant\\'s Wordpress blog. The wallets addresses for Bitcoin and ERC20/Polygon/BSC were also provided.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\nNothing new happened.\n\"\"\"\n"
