"I used the \"browse_website\" command to search for information on martial arts. The website provided information on the different styles and philosophies of martial arts, including traditional/historical arts vs. contemporary styles, armed vs. unarmed techniques, and self-defense vs. combat sport vs. physical fitness applications. The website also covered the origins and evolution of martial arts into sports, their use in military and law enforcement, and the global industry of millions of practitioners. The website mentioned various styles and origins of martial arts from different countries and regions, as well as different techniques and weapons used in martial arts."
