"I received a command to browse the National Geographic website for interesting resources related to exploration and learning. The website provided a collection of articles, podcasts, and videos on various topics. Some interesting resources included a guide to visiting Maine, a video on exploring Austin, Texas, and articles on shipwrecks discovered on an ancient sea route and the history of modern drag. The website links were provided."
