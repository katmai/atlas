"I used the \"browse_website\" command to explore the Scholastic website and found that it offers educational materials and activities for children, including literacy and math resources, book fairs and clubs, and workbooks for early literacy and numeracy. The website also features book reviews and information on new book releases, and offers resources for teachers. Contact information for Scholastic representatives and customer support is provided."
