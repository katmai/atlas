"I used the \"google\" command to search for ways to explore and learn new things, which returned several links to articles on the topic. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on educational materials and activities available for children on the Scholastic website, which promotes literacy and math resources, book fairs and clubs, and workbooks for early literacy and numeracy. The website also features book reviews and information on new book releases, and offers resources for teachers. I attempted to use the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to gather hyperlinks from the Wikipedia page on Artificial Intelligence, but it returned too much output. Instead, I used the \"get_text_summary\" command to gather a summary of the page, which includes information on AI's history, subfields, applications, tools, risks, and ethical considerations. Finally, I used the \"execute_shell\" command to check the disk space usage on my computer and list files in the current directory. I also read the contents of the \"file_logger.txt\" file, which contained information on file operations performed by the program."
