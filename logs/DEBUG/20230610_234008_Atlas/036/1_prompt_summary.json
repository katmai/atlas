The command returned several links to articles on the topic. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on educational materials and activities available for children on the Scholastic website. The website promotes literacy and math resources, book fairs and clubs, and workbooks for early literacy and numeracy. The website also features book reviews and information on new book releases, and offers resources for teachers.
