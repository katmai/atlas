I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on educational materials and activities for children on the Scholastic website. The website offers literacy and math resources, book fairs and clubs, teaching resources, book reviews, and Little Skill Seekers Workbooks for early literacy, numeracy, and cognitive skills. Contact information for Scholastic representatives and customer support is provided. The command also returned several links, including the main content and catalogs pages.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"df -h && ls -l\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content=\"Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT:\\nb'Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\\\\noverlay         3.7T  882G  2.9T  24% /\\\\ntmpfs            64M     0   64M   0% /dev\\\\ntmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\\\\nshm              64M     0   64M   0% /dev/shm\\\\n/dev/md0        3.7T  882G  2.9T  24% /etc/hosts\\\\ntmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /proc/asound\\\\ntmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /proc/acpi\\\\ntmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /proc/scsi\\\\ntmpfs            32G     0   32G   0% /sys/firmware\\\\ntotal 876\\\\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root     27 Jun 10 23:10 Atlas\\\\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   1281 Jun 10 23:08 ai_code.py\\\\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 877188 Jun 10 23:54 atlas.json\\\\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 1000 rvm     912 Jun 10 18:26 atlas.settings.yaml\\\\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 1000 rvm    1062 Jun 10 22:24 atlas.yaml\\\\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    205 Jun 10 23:08 file_logger.txt\\\\n'\\nSTDERR:\\nb''\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
