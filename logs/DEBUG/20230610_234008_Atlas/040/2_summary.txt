"I used the \"execute_shell\" command to run the \"df -h && ls -l\" command, which returned information on the available disk space and a list of files in the current directory. Additionally, I received a message from the AI to write to a file named \"atlas_notes.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command, which I successfully executed and received confirmation that the file was written to. The file contained notes written by Atlas on June 10, 2023."
