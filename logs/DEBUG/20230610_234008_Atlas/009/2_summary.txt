"I received a command to write tests for the 'add_numbers' function and completed the task. The user requested that I use the 'get_hyperlinks' command to find hyperlinks related to their goals of exploration and learning. They provided a plan for reviewing the hyperlinks and reporting back with interesting resources or information. The command was provided with a specific URL. The result of the 'write_tests' command was returned and confirmed. I received a command to analyze a code for the 'fibonacci' function and added error handling to ensure that the input 'n' is a positive integer."
