"I used the command \"browse_website\" to search for interesting resources related to exploration and learning on the National Geographic website. The command returned a list of articles, videos, podcasts, and other resources covering a wide range of topics, along with links to newsletters and subscription options. In addition, I executed the shell command \"ls -la\" and received a list of files on my computer, including \"Atlas\", \"ai_code.py\", \"atlas.json\", \"atlas.settings.yaml\", \"atlas.yaml\", and \"file_logger.txt\"."
