"I used the \"google\" command to search for \"exploration and learning resources\" and received a list of links that include resources for outdoor nature exploration, ethnomathematics, and educational droppers. One of the links is the National Geographic Society's education resources page. I used the \"browse_website\" command to visit the National Geographic website and found a collection of articles, videos, podcasts, and other resources available covering a wide range of topics related to exploration, learning, and conservation. These resources include travel guides, history and culture articles, wildlife and environmental news, and more."
