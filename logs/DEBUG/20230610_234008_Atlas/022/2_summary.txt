"I attempted to get hyperlinks from the National Geographic website, but the command failed due to too much output. Instead, I used the \"get_text_summary\" command to gather information. The summary states that the website offers a collection of articles, videos, podcasts, and travel guides on various topics, including environment, animals, history, culture, and travel. It also includes information about the National Geographic Society's nonprofit work and ways to support their mission. There is still no direct information about exploration and learning resources."
