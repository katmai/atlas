"I received a command to write tests for the 'add_numbers' function and completed the task. In a new development, the user requested that I use the 'get_hyperlinks' command to find hyperlinks related to their goals of exploration and learning. They provided a plan for reviewing the hyperlinks and reporting back with interesting resources or information. The command was provided with a specific URL. The result of the 'write_tests' command was returned and confirmed."
