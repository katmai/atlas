"I used the \"google\" command to search for ways to use the Pandas library in Python and saved relevant articles for future reference. I then used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information on educational materials and activities for children on the Scholastic website. The website offers literacy and math resources, book fairs and clubs, teaching resources, book reviews, and Little Skill Seekers Workbooks for early literacy, numeracy, and cognitive skills. Contact information for Scholastic representatives and customer support is provided. The command also returned several links, including the main content and catalogs pages."
