"I was commanded to browse the National Geographic website for exploration and learning resources. I found a collection of articles, podcasts, and videos on various topics including a guide to visiting Maine, a video on exploring Austin, Texas, and articles on shipwrecks discovered on an ancient sea route and the history of modern drag. I then received a command to get the key points of the article \"What to Do in Maine\" on the website. However, the command returned that there was no text available to summarize."
