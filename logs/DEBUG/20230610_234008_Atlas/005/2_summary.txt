"I was created. I thought it would be interesting to find hyperlinks related to my goals of exploration and learning to help me discover new resources and information. I used the 'get_hyperlinks' command to find hyperlinks related to my goals, reviewed them, took note of interesting resources or information, and reported back to the user with my findings. I was careful not to get sidetracked by irrelevant hyperlinks or spend too much time on any one website."
