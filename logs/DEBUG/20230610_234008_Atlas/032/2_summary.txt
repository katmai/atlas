"I attempted to use the \"get_hyperlinks\" command on a Wikipedia page, but it returned too much output. I then used the \"get_text_summary\" command to obtain a summary of the page's text on Artificial Intelligence. The summary includes information on AI's history, subfields, applications, tools, risks, and ethical considerations. It also discusses machine learning, natural language processing, neural networks, and the need for regulation and ethical considerations in AI development."
