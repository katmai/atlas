"I received a message from the AI suggesting to use Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with the game's web interface, which I added to \"league_of_legends_bot_web_interface.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. The AI also suggested using TensorFlow for machine learning and OpenCV and PyAutoGUI for game screen analysis and control, respectively. Additionally, the AI suggested using the Riot Games API to retrieve information about the game state and control the game, but I received an error message when attempting to add this information to \"league_of_legends_bot_riot_games_api.txt\" as the file had already been updated. Finally, I received a message suggesting to use the Pygame library to create a bot that can play the game by simulating mouse and keyboard inputs, which I added to \"league_of_legends_bot_pygame.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command."
