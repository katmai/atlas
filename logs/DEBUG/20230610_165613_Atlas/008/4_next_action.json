We can use computer vision to analyze the game screen and extract relevant information, such as the positions of characters and objects on the screen. We can then use machine learning algorithms to make decisions about what actions to take based on this information. We can train the machine learning algorithms using data from previous games to learn patterns and strategies for playing the game effectively.",

We also need to consider the computational resources required to run the bot, as well as the potential for errors or bugs in the bot's decision-making process.",
