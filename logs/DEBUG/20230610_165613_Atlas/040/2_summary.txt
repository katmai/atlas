"I attempted to write to \"league_of_legends_bot_selenium.txt\" with \"write_to_file\" but got an error saying it had been updated. I learned about different libraries and APIs to automate interactions with the game's web interface and control the game, and added this info to different text files. I received a message to write to \"league_of_legends_bot_pygame.txt\" using \"write_to_file\", adding that Pygame can create a GUI for the bot and display game state info."
