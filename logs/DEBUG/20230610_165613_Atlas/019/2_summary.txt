"I received a message from the AI suggesting that we can use the Riot Games API to retrieve information about the game state and control the game. I added this information to \"riot_games_api_usage.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. In addition, the AI suggested that we can use OpenCV to analyze the game screen and extract relevant information, which I added to \"league_of_legends_bot_development.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command."
