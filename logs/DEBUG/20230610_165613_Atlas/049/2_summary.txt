"I added a new command called \"write_to_file\" with the filename \"league_of_legends_bot_pyautogui.txt\" and text \"We can use the PyAutoGUI library to simulate mouse and keyboard input to control the game.\" This allows us to use PyAutoGUI to simulate mouse and keyboard input to control the game. We can now use TensorFlow to create a machine learning model to play the game, Pygame to create a graphical user interface for the bot, Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with the game's web interface, and OpenCV to process and analyze images from the game."
