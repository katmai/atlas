"I received a message suggesting the use of PyTesseract library for optical character recognition (OCR) on the game screen and extract text information. I executed the \"write_to_file\" command with the given filename \"league_of_legends_bot_pytesseract.txt\" and text \"We can use the PyTesseract library to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the game screen and extract text information\", and the file was written successfully. In addition to PyAutoGUI, TensorFlow, the Riot Games API, and OpenCV, I now have the option to use PyTesseract for game analysis. Another message suggested the use of Selenium to automate web browser interactions and control the game client, which I have already written to a file successfully."
