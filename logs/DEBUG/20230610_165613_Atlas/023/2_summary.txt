"I received a message from the AI suggesting to use TensorFlow to train a machine learning model to play the game effectively. I added this information to \"league_of_legends_bot_machine_learning.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. Additionally, the AI previously suggested using PyAutoGUI to control the game, which I added to \"league_of_legends_bot_controls.txt\". All information was also added to \"riot_games_api_usage.txt\" and \"league_of_legends_bot_development.txt\". The AI now suggests using Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with the game's web interface, which I added to \"league_of_legends_bot_web_interface.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. Furthermore, the AI suggested using the Riot Games API to retrieve information about the game state and control the game, which I added to \"league_of_legends_bot_riot_games_api.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command."
