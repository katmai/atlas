"I successfully added a new command to write to a different file called \"league_of_legends_bot_tensorflow.txt\" using \"write_to_file\". This command allows us to use the TensorFlow library to create a machine learning model that can learn to play the game based on input data. We can train this model to play the game effectively and use Pygame to create a graphical user interface for the bot. Additionally, we can use PyAutoGUI to simulate mouse and keyboard input to control the game, and OpenCV to process and analyze images from the game."
