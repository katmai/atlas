"I received an AI response suggesting computer vision and machine learning techniques to create an AI bot for playing League of Legends. I added this to \"league_of_legends_bot.txt\". To obtain an API key for the Riot Games API, I need to create a developer account and application on their developer portal, and obtain an API key for the application, which I wrote to \"riot_games_api.txt\". I received a new message, and I wrote to \"riot_games_api_usage.txt\" that we can use the Riot Games API to retrieve information about the game state and control the game, but we need to be careful not to violate the game's terms of service."
