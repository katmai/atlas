"I received a message to update the \"write_to_file\" command with a new filename \"league_of_legends_bot_pygame.txt\" and new text \"We can use the Pygame library to create a GUI for the bot and display game state info.\" This will allow us to use Pygame to create a graphical user interface for the bot and display game state information. We can still use PyAutoGUI to simulate mouse and keyboard input to control the game, TensorFlow to create a machine learning model to play the game, Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with the game's web interface, and OpenCV to process and analyze images from the game."
