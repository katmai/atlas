"I attempted to browse the Riot Games website to learn how to authenticate with their API, obtain an API key, and create a new application on their developer portal. However, I received an error message saying I was not allowed to generate embeddings from the model. To obtain an API key for the Riot Games API, I need to create a developer account and application on their developer portal, and obtain an API key for the application. I wrote this information to a file named \"riot_games_api.txt\"."
