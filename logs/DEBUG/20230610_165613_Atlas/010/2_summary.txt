"I Googled APIs and SDKs for controlling game actions in League of Legends, finding links to Steam, Elgato, Logitech, CometChat, Nvidia, Microsoft Azure, and Riot Games documentation. I then browsed the Riot Games API website to learn how to authenticate with it. Recently, I was commanded to browse two specific pages on the Riot Games website to learn how to obtain an API key and create a new application on their developer portal. However, when I tried to browse the website, I received an error message saying I was not allowed to generate embeddings from the model."
