"I added information to \"league_of_legends_bot_controls.txt\" about using PyAutoGUI to control the mouse and keyboard to interact with the game, but being careful not to violate the game's terms of service. Additionally, I received a message that we need to obtain an API key for the Riot Games API in order to use it to retrieve information about the game state and control the game, and wrote this information to \"riot_games_api_key.txt\"."
