"I received a new message suggesting the use of the Pygame library to create a GUI for the bot and display game state info. I executed the \"write_to_file\" command with the given filename \"league_of_legends_bot_pygame.txt\" and text \"We can use the Pygame library to create a GUI for the bot and display game state info\", and the file was written successfully. In addition to PyAutoGUI, I have also received suggestions to use TensorFlow to create a machine learning model and the Riot Games API to retrieve information about the game state and the player's account."
