"I received a message from the AI suggesting to use Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with the game's web interface, which I added to \"league_of_legends_bot_web_interface.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. The AI also previously suggested using TensorFlow for machine learning and OpenCV and PyAutoGUI for game screen analysis and control, respectively. In addition, the AI suggested using the Riot Games API to retrieve information about the game state and control the game, but when I attempted to add this information to \"league_of_legends_bot_riot_games_api.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command, I received an error message indicating that the file had already been updated."
