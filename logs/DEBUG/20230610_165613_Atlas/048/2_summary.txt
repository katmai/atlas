"I added a new command called \"write_to_file\" with the filename \"league_of_legends_bot_selenium.txt\" and text \"We can use the Selenium WebDriver library to automate interactions with the game's web interface.\" This allows us to automate interactions with the game's web interface using the Selenium WebDriver library. We can now use TensorFlow to create a machine learning model to play the game, Pygame to create a graphical user interface for the bot, PyAutoGUI to simulate mouse and keyboard input, and OpenCV to process and analyze images from the game."
