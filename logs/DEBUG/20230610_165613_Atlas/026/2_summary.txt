"I received a message from the AI suggesting to use TensorFlow to train a machine learning model to play the game effectively. I added this information to \"league_of_legends_bot_machine_learning.txt\" using the \"write_to_file\" command. All previous information was added to respective files. Additionally, the AI suggested using OpenCV to analyze the game screen and extract relevant information, and PyAutoGUI to control the game by simulating mouse and keyboard inputs, which I added to \"league_of_legends_bot_opencv.txt\" and \"league_of_legends_bot_controls.txt\" respectively using the \"write_to_file\" command."
