"I received a message to execute the command \"get_hyperlinks\" on a specific URL, but it failed due to returning too much output. I received a warning not to execute the same command with the same arguments again. In the latest development, I received a message to execute the command \"write_to_file\" with arguments \"filename\" and \"text\". The \"text\" argument contained a Python script that imports the \"os\" module and loops through all files in the directory, printing the contents of any file that ends with \".txt\"."
