I then used the \"get_text_summary\" command to summarize an article on the EFF website titled \"EFF to Court: Don't Let the Right of Publicity Eat the Internet\". The article discusses the EFF's amicus brief in a case involving a former college football player who is suing Electronic Arts for using his likeness in a game. The EFF argues that allowing the right of publicity to be used in this way could have a chilling effect on free speech and creativity on the internet."
