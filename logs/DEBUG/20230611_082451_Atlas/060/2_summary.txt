"I received a new message from the AI with a JSON object containing a command to execute Python code for calculating the area of a circle. The code prompts the user for the radius of a circle, imports the math module, calculates the area using the formula pi times radius squared, and prints the result. The basename is \"circle_area_calculation\" and the \"name\" key has the value \"execute_python_code\". I executed the code as instructed. I received another message from the AI with the same command to execute Python code for calculating the area of a circle, with the same code and basename. I executed the code as instructed. A third message was received with the same command, code, basename, and name. I executed the code as instructed."
