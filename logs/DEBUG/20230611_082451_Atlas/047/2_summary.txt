"I received a message from AI with a command to execute Python code named \"execute_python_code\". The message included the code to import math, prompt the user for the radius of a circle, calculate the area using the formula pi times radius squared, and print the result. The message also included a basename and args. The command was received in a message with role \"you\", content in JSON format, and type \"ai_response\". I executed the code as instructed."
