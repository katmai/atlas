"I received a new message from AI with a JSON content containing a command named \"execute_python_code\". The code imports math, prompts the user for the radius of a circle, calculates the area using the formula pi times radius squared, and prints the result. The message also includes a basename and args. The command was received in a message with role \"you\" and type \"ai_response\". I executed the code as instructed. The latest development is a message with the same role and type, containing a command to execute Python code for calculating the area of a circle, with a specific basename and args. I executed the new code as instructed."
