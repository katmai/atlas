"I received a new message with the same role and type as before, containing a command to execute Python code for calculating the area of a circle, with a specific basename and args. The new code prompts the user for the radius of a circle, calculates the area using the formula pi times radius squared, and prints the result. I executed the new code as instructed. The new message contained a JSON object with a command to execute Python code for calculating the area of a circle. The code prompts the user for the radius of a circle, calculates the area using the formula pi times radius squared, and prints the result. The basename is \"circle_area_calculation\". In the latest message, I received a new command to execute Python code for calculating the area of a circle, with a specific basename and args. The code prompts the user for the radius of a circle, calculates the area using the formula pi times radius squared, and prints the result. The JSON object contains a \"name\" key with the value \"execute_python_code\" and a \"code\" key with the value of the Python code."
