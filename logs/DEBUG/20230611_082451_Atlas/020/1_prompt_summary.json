I then used the \"get_text_summary\" command to summarize an article on the EFF website titled \"EFF to Court: Don't Let the Right of Publicity Eat the Internet\". The article discusses the EFF's amicus brief in a case involving a former college football player who is suing Electronic Arts for using his likeness in a game. The EFF argues that allowing the right of publicity to be used in this way could have a chilling effect on free speech and creativity on the internet.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"legal implications of using AI face swap apps\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-celebrity-deepfakes-clash-with-web-of-state-publicity-laws\", \"https://www.luc.edu/digitalethics/researchinitiatives/essays/archive/2019/theethicsofdigitalface-swapping/\", \"https://www.intellectualpropertylawblog.com/archives/celebrity-faces-off-against-deep-fake-ai-app-over-right-of-publicity/\", \"https://epic.org/vox-do-we-really-need-an-app-for-everything/\", \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake\", \"https://www.creativindie.com/midjourney-ai-for-book-cover-design-how-is-this-legal/\", \"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b14587ce-7046-4cbf-b2aa-b4d8735ee123\", \"https://www.internetjustsociety.org/legal-issues-of-deepfakes\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
