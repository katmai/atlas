"I used the \"google\" command to search for legal implications of using AI face swap apps and found multiple links discussing the topic. I also used the \"browse_website\" command to check the Electronic Frontier Foundation's stance on AI face swap apps, but found no information. However, I did find an article on their website about defending free speech and creativity on the internet. The EFF has achieved recent victories in defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation, including rulings requiring warrants for cell phone searches at the border and detailed information about facial recognition algorithms used by police. They also oppose a bill that would require messaging platforms to report users to the DEA."
