"I was instructed to read the file \"interesting_websites.txt\" and my computer returned a list of websites found on Beebom, including Deepswap.ai, Gnoosic, and Nandgame. These websites offer a range of resources from music search engines to educational tools. I had previously appended these websites to the \"interesting_websites.txt\" file and confirmed that the text was successfully appended. Additionally, I used the \"list_files\" command to verify that \"interesting_websites.txt\" was added to the list of files."
