The FDA has lifted an import alert on certain food products from Japanese prefectures near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, but continues to monitor seafood for radionuclides. The FDA warns consumers to be wary of fraudulent products claiming to prevent or treat the harmful effects of radiation exposure and has procedures and laboratory techniques for measuring radionuclide levels in food. A scientific study recommends greater consideration of local stakeholders and the importance of maintaining societal trust in the quality of Fukushima waters and seafood during the releases, urging international institutions and the science-policy community to engage more fully with local researchers within Japan.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"browse_website\", \"args\": {\"url\": \"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-response-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-power-facility-incident\", \"question\": \"What is the FDA\\'s response to the Fukushima Dai\\'ichi nuclear power plant incident, and what are the potential risks of consuming seafood caught in the Pacific Ocean after the release of treated nuclear wastewater from the plant?\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content=\"Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The FDA has lifted an import alert on certain food products from Japanese prefectures near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, after determining a low risk to American consumers from radioactive contaminated foods imported from Japan. The FDA continues to monitor seafood for radionuclides, but does not anticipate any public health effect on seafood safety in the US due to the ocean's vastness and dilution effects.
