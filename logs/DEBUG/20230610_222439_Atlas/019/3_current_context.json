The FDA warns consumers to be wary of fraudulent products claiming to prevent or treat the harmful effects of radiation exposure and has procedures and laboratory techniques for measuring radionuclide levels in food. I also searched for the scientific consensus on the potential risks of consuming seafood caught in the Pacific Ocean after the release of treated nuclear wastewater from the plant on the PubMed database, but found no information."
