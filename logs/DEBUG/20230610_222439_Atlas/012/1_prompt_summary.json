There is controversy surrounding Japan's plan to release over a million tons of treated nuclear wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, as it contains radioactive isotopes and could potentially harm ecosystems. Some countries and American scientists are urging Japan to delay the releases due to a lack of adequate and accurate scientific data supporting Japan's assertion of safety. The International Atomic Energy Agency is reviewing the intended wastewater releases against international safety standards and is expected to release a report in late June.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"browse_website\", \"args\": {\"url\": \"https://www.npr.org/2021/04/13/986695494/japan-to-dump-wastewater-from-wrecked-fukushima-nuclear-plant-into-pacific-ocean\", \"question\": \"\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content=\"Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: Japan has announced plans to release over a million tons of treated but still radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean in two years. Despite Tokyo's assurances that the discharge will not pose a threat to people or the environment, the decision has been criticized by the local fishing community, environmental groups, and Japan's neighbors. The water will be further treated and diluted, and the release will take decades to complete. The damaged Fukushima plant will take at least decades to decommission, and a swath of land around the plant remains uninhabitable.\\n\\nLinks: ['Skip to main content (https://www.npr.org/2021/04/13/986695494/japan-to-dump-wastewater-from-wrecked-fukushima-nuclear-plant-into-pacific-ocean#mainContent)', 'Keyboard shortcuts for audio player (https://help.npr.org/contact/s/article?name=what-are-the-keyboard-shortcuts-for-using-the-npr-org-audio-player)', '\\\\n\\\\n (https://www.npr.org/)', 'Sign In (https://www.npr.org/2021/04/13/986695494/japan-to-dump-wastewater-from-wrecked-fukushima-nuclear-plant-into-pacific-ocean)', 'NPR Shop (https://shopnpr.org)']\", type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
