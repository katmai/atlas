"I received information that Japan plans to release over a million tons of treated but still radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean in two years. The water will be further treated and diluted, and the release will take decades to complete. Despite Tokyo's assurances that the discharge will not pose a threat to people or the environment, the decision has been criticized by the local fishing community, environmental groups, and Japan's neighbors. The damaged Fukushima plant will take at least decades to decommission, and a swath of land around the plant remains uninhabitable."
