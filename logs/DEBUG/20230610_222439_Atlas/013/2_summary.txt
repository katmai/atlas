"I searched for scientific studies on the potential environmental impact of treated nuclear wastewater in the Pacific Ocean and received several results, including articles from the National Geographic and the EPA. The Fukushima plant will take decades to decommission and a swath of land around the plant remains uninhabitable. Japan plans to release over a million tons of treated but still radioactive wastewater from the plant into the Pacific Ocean in two years, which has been criticized by the local fishing community, environmental groups, and Japan's neighbors. The water will be further treated and diluted, and the release will take decades to complete. Tokyo assures that the discharge will not pose a threat to people or the environment."
