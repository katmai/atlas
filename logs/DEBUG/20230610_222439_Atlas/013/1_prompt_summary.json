The water will be further treated and diluted, and the release will take decades to complete. Despite Tokyo's assurances that the discharge will not pose a threat to people or the environment, the decision has been criticized by the local fishing community, environmental groups, and Japan's neighbors. The damaged Fukushima plant will take at least decades to decommission, and a swath of land around the plant remains uninhabitable.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"scientific studies on the potential environmental impact of treated nuclear wastewater in the pacific ocean\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9659344/\", \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666683921000183\", \"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/fukushima-japan-nuclear-wastewater-pacific-ocean\", \"https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/learn-about-ocean-dumping\", \"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es202816c\", \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35170214/\", \"https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/www3/region9/water/recycling/\", \"https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2021/04/fukushima-dumping-radioactive-wastewater-in-the-pacific-is-an-easy-but-wrong-solution\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
