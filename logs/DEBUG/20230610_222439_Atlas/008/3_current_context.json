The wastewater contains radioactive isotopes, and experts are concerned about its potential environmental threat and impact on ecosystems. Some countries and American scientists are urging Japan to delay the releases, citing a lack of adequate and accurate scientific data supporting Japan's assertion of safety. The International Atomic Energy Agency is reviewing the intended wastewater releases against international safety standards and is expected to release a report in late June.\n\nLinks: [' (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/)', ' (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/search)', 'Newsletters (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/newsletters/signup)', 'Subscribe (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/subscribe)', 'Environment (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment)']"
