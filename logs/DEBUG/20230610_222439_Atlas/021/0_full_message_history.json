The water will be further treated and diluted, and the release will take decades to complete. The damaged Fukushima plant will take at least decades to decommission, and a swath of land around the plant remains uninhabitable.\n\nLinks: ['Skip to main content (https://www.npr.org/2021/04/13/986695494/japan-to-dump-wastewater-from-wrecked-fukushima-nuclear-plant-into-pacific-ocean#mainContent)', 'Keyboard shortcuts for audio player (https://help.npr.org/contact/s/article?name=what-are-the-keyboard-shortcuts-for-using-the-npr-org-audio-player)', '\\n\\n (https://www.npr.org/)', 'Sign In (https://www.npr.org/2021/04/13/986695494/japan-to-dump-wastewater-from-wrecked-fukushima-nuclear-plant-into-pacific-ocean)', 'NPR Shop (https://shopnpr.org)']"
