"I received a summary of a scientific study on the potential environmental impact of treated nuclear wastewater in the Pacific Ocean. The study recommends greater consideration of local stakeholders, particularly fishers and coastal communities, in the decision-making process and the creation of long-term partnerships between stakeholders. The study also emphasizes the importance of maintaining societal trust in the quality of Fukushima waters and seafood during the releases and urges international institutions and the science-policy community to engage more fully with local researchers within Japan."
