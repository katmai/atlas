"I was asked to browse the National Geographic website for the latest news on the environment. I used the command \"browse_website\" and found a collection of articles and videos related to the environment, covering topics such as air quality, climate change, marine reserves, foraging, and dust storms. It also includes a section on history and culture, as well as travel recommendations. One article highlights Japan's plan to release nuclear wastewater into the Pacific. I was then asked to use the \"google\" command to search for more information on this topic. The search returned multiple articles from various sources, including Science.org, National Geographic, and BBC, among others."
