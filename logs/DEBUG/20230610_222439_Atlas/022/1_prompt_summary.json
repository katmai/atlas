I also browsed a website and found two research papers published in the Journal of Disaster Research, one discussing residents' understanding of the risks of consuming seafood from the Pacific Ocean after the Fukushima Dai'ichi nuclear power plant disaster. The website also included articles on incident command systems, sociocultural factors in urban search and rescue teams, and excess mortality possibly due to COVID-19 in Tokyo.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"potential risks of consuming seafood caught in the Pacific Ocean after the release of treated nuclear wastewater from the Fukushima Dai\\'ichi nuclear power plant\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-response-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-power-facility-incident\", \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9659344/\", \"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/asia/japan-fukushima-disaster-wastewater-fishing-concerns-hnk-dst-dg-intl/index.html\", \"https://apnews.com/article/japan-fukushima-daiichi-radioactive-water-release-75becaaf68b7c3faf0121c459fdd25af\", \"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56728068\", \"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/15/fukushima-japan-insists-release-of-treated-water-is-safe-nuclear-disaster\", \"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/fukushima-radiation-us-west-coast-tuna\", \"https://hakaimagazine.com/article-short/fukushima-radioactive-wastewater-dilemma/\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
