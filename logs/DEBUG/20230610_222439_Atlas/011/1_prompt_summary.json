The website provided details that Japan plans to release over a million tons of treated nuclear wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, causing controversy among neighboring countries and scientists. The wastewater contains radioactive isotopes, and experts are concerned about its potential environmental threat and impact on ecosystems. Some countries and American scientists are urging Japan to delay the releases, citing a lack of adequate and accurate scientific data supporting Japan's assertion of safety. The International Atomic Energy Agency is reviewing the intended wastewater releases against international safety standards and is expected to release a report in late June.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"potential environmental impact of treated nuclear wastewater in the pacific ocean\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/fukushima-japan-nuclear-wastewater-pacific-ocean\", \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666683921000183\", \"https://www.npr.org/2021/04/13/986695494/japan-to-dump-wastewater-from-wrecked-fukushima-nuclear-plant-into-pacific-ocean\", \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965262104186X\", \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9659344/\", \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35170214/\", \"https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2021/04/fukushima-dumping-radioactive-wastewater-in-the-pacific-is-an-easy-but-wrong-solution\", \"https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/learn-about-ocean-dumping\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
