"I searched for the potential environmental impact of treated nuclear wastewater in the Pacific Ocean and received several sources, including National Geographic, NPR, and scientific articles. There is controversy surrounding Japan's plan to release over a million tons of treated nuclear wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, as it contains radioactive isotopes and could potentially harm ecosystems. Some countries and American scientists are urging Japan to delay the releases due to a lack of adequate and accurate scientific data supporting Japan's assertion of safety. The International Atomic Energy Agency is reviewing the intended wastewater releases against international safety standards and is expected to release a report in late June."
