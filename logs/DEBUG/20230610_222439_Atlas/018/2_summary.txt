"I googled the potential risks of consuming seafood caught in the Pacific Ocean after the release of treated nuclear wastewater from the Fukushima Dai'ichi nuclear power plant and found several sources, including the FDA's response to the incident. The FDA has lifted an import alert on certain food products from Japanese prefectures near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, but continues to monitor seafood for radionuclides. The FDA warns consumers to be wary of fraudulent products claiming to prevent or treat the harmful effects of radiation exposure and has procedures and laboratory techniques for measuring radionuclide levels in food. A scientific study recommends greater consideration of local stakeholders and the importance of maintaining societal trust in the quality of Fukushima waters and seafood during the releases, urging international institutions and the science-policy community to engage more fully with local researchers within Japan."
