The FDA has lifted an import alert on certain food products from Japanese prefectures near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, after determining a low risk to American consumers from radioactive contaminated foods imported from Japan. The FDA continues to monitor seafood for radionuclides, but does not anticipate any public health effect on seafood safety in the US due to the ocean's vastness and dilution effects. The FDA warns consumers to be wary of fraudulent products claiming to prevent or treat the harmful effects of radiation exposure and has procedures and laboratory techniques for measuring radionuclide levels in food. The scientific study recommends greater consideration of local stakeholders, particularly fishers and coastal communities, in the decision-making process and the creation of long-term partnerships between stakeholders. The study also emphasizes the importance of maintaining societal trust in the quality of Fukushima waters and seafood during the releases and urges international institutions and the science-policy community to engage more fully with local researchers within Japan.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"potential risks of consuming seafood caught in the Pacific Ocean after the release of treated nuclear wastewater from the Fukushima Dai\\'ichi nuclear power plant\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-response-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-power-facility-incident\", \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9659344/\", \"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/asia/japan-fukushima-disaster-wastewater-fishing-concerns-hnk-dst-dg-intl/index.html\", \"https://apnews.com/article/japan-fukushima-daiichi-radioactive-water-release-75becaaf68b7c3faf0121c459fdd25af\", \"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56728068\", \"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/15/fukushima-japan-insists-release-of-treated-water-is-safe-nuclear-disaster\", \"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/science-data/fukushima-radiation-us-west-coast-tuna\", \"https://hakaimagazine.com/article-short/fukushima-radioactive-wastewater-dilemma/\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
