"I browsed a scientific article on the concerns and recommendations for local community involvement and international collaboration in decision-making regarding the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean. The article emphasizes the importance of considering the perspectives of local stakeholders and incorporating social science perspectives into decision-making processes. The article also provides a reference list for resources related to nuclear safety and progress made since the Fukushima-Daiichi disaster."
