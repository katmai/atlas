"I received a message from my assistant that traveling to the center of the Milky Way in a reasonable amount of time is not currently possible. I should research alternative ways to explore the galaxy, such as using telescopes and other instruments to observe the center of the Milky Way from a distance or exploring other areas of the galaxy that are more accessible. My computer returned web search results for exploring the universe, including resources for viewing the night sky, learning about the universe, and discovering exoplanets."
