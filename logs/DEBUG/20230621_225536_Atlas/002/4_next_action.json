        "text": "To travel to the center of the Milky Way in a decent amount of time, I need to find a way to travel faster than the speed of light. However, this is not currently possible according to the laws of physics. Therefore, I need to consider alternative ways to explore the galaxy. Perhaps I can use telescopes and other instruments to observe the center of the Milky Way from a distance. Alternatively, I can explore other areas of the galaxy that are more accessible. I should do some research to determine the best approach.",
