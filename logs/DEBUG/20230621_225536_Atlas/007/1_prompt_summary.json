I should research alternative ways to explore the galaxy, such as using telescopes and other instruments to observe the center of the Milky Way from a distance or exploring other areas of the galaxy that are more accessible. My computer returned web search results for exploring the universe, including resources for viewing the night sky, learning about the universe, and discovering exoplanets. \n\nI received a response from my computer after searching for alternative ways to explore the galaxy. The search results include a variety of resources for exploring the universe, such as an interactive map of 200,000 galaxies, a website for viewing the night sky, and a resource for discovering exoplanets. Additionally, I found an article about the most energy-efficient way of settling as many star systems as possible.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"browse_website\", \"args\": {\"url\": \"https://theconversation.com/hunting-galaxies-far-far-away-heres-how-anyone-can-explore-the-universe-172233\", \"question\": \"What are some ways to explore the universe without traveling to the center of the Milky Way?\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: an article explaining how anyone can explore the universe without traveling to the center of the Milky Way. The author, an astronomer, describes how to use online tools like Aladin Lite to search for and view images of galaxies, including spiral, elliptical, and lenticular galaxies. The article also provides information on how to interpret the colors and wavelengths of the images to learn about the stars and activity within the galaxies.\\n\\nLinks: [\\'here (https://theconversation.com/global/privacy-policy)\\', \"View our partners (javascript:Didomi.preferences.show(\\'vendors\\'))\", \\'\\\\n    Menu\\\\n   (https://theconversation.com/hunting-galaxies-far-far-away-heres-how-anyone-can-explore-the-universe-172233)\\', \\'\\\\n    Close\\\\n   (https://theconversation.com/hunting-galaxies-far-far-away-heres-how-anyone-can-explore-the-universe-172233)\\', \\'Home (https://theconversation.com/europe)\\']', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
