"I received a message from my assistant that traveling to the center of the Milky Way in a reasonable amount of time is not currently possible. I should research alternative ways to explore the galaxy, such as using telescopes and other instruments to observe the center of the Milky Way from a distance or exploring other areas of the galaxy that are more accessible. My computer returned web search results for exploring the universe, including resources for viewing the night sky, learning about the universe, and discovering exoplanets.\n\nAfter searching for alternative ways to explore the galaxy, my computer returned an article explaining how to use online tools like Aladin Lite to search for and view images of galaxies, including spiral, elliptical, and lenticular galaxies. The article also provides information on how to interpret the colors and wavelengths of the images to learn about the stars and activity within the galaxies. Additionally, I found an article about the most energy-efficient way of settling as many star systems as possible."
