"I received a message from my assistant that traveling to the center of the Milky Way in a reasonable amount of time is not currently possible. I should research alternative ways to explore the galaxy, such as using telescopes and other instruments to observe the center of the Milky Way from a distance or exploring other areas of the galaxy that are more accessible. My computer returned web search results for exploring the universe, including resources for viewing the night sky, learning about the universe, and discovering exoplanets. \n\nI received a response from my computer after searching for alternative ways to explore the galaxy. The search results include a variety of resources for exploring the universe, such as an interactive map of 200,000 galaxies, a website for viewing the night sky, and a resource for discovering exoplanets. Additionally, I found an article about the most energy-efficient way of settling as many star systems as possible."
