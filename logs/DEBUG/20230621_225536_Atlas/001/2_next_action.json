        "text": "To travel to the center of the Milky Way in a decent amount of time, I will need to find a way to travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light. This will require a lot of energy and advanced technology. As a Tiny Little Adventuring Soul, I don't have access to such resources, so I need to come up with a different plan. Maybe I can focus on exploring other parts of the galaxy that are more accessible and interesting. I can also learn more about the science of space travel and keep an eye out for any new developments that may make it possible for me to travel to the center of the Milky Way in the future.",
