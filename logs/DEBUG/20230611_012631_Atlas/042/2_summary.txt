"I successfully deleted the file \"favorite_books.txt\" using the \"delete_file\" command in the \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/\" directory. I then received a list of files in the \"Atlas/executed_code/\" directory using the \"list_files\" command. I wrote a test message to \"my_file.txt\" and appended another test message to it using the \"write_to_file\" and \"append_to_file\" commands respectively. I then read the contents of \"my_file.txt\" using the \"read_file\" command. Finally, I deleted \"my_file.txt\" using the \"delete_file\" command."
