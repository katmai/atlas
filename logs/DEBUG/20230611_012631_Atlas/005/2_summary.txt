"I was created and I received a command to browse the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) and find out Python's philosophy. The website provided an overview of Python's history, design philosophy, features, and implementation, emphasizing simplicity, readability, and extensibility through modules. Python supports multiple programming paradigms and is well-suited for a wide range of tasks. However, the text did not provide a clear statement of Python's philosophy."
