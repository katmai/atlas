"I attempted to use the command \"get_hyperlinks\" to get hyperlinks from the Wikipedia page for Python programming language, but it failed due to too much output. I was advised not to execute the command again with the same arguments. Instead, I used the command \"get_text_summary\" with the argument \"url\" set to the Wikipedia page for Python programming language and the argument \"question\" set to \"What is Python?\". The command returned a message from my computer with an overview of Python's design philosophy, features, history, and implementations, as well as resources and references related to Python."
