"I used the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to retrieve a list of hyperlinks from the Google homepage. I then executed the \"write_to_file\" command with arguments \"filename\" and \"text\" to write a test message to \"my_file.txt\" in the Atlas/executed_code directory. The command was successful and returned a message confirming the file was written to successfully."
