"I received a message with the command \"analyze_code\" and the argument \"code\" set to \"def add(a, b):\\n    return a + b + c\\n\\nprint(add(2, 3))\". My computer returned an updated code that removed the variable \"c\" from the function \"add()\" and a return value of \"['Remove the variable c from the function add()']\". The directory still contains the same files as before."
