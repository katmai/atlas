"I used the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to retrieve a list of hyperlinks from the Google homepage. I executed the \"write_to_file\" command with arguments \"filename\" and \"text\" to write a test message to \"my_file.txt\" in the Atlas/executed_code directory, and then appended another test message to the same file. I also used the \"read_file\" command to read the contents of \"favorite_books.txt\" and tried to replace a line that did not exist, resulting in an error message. I then appended a new book to \"favorite_books.txt\" and deleted the file. I executed a Python script and read the contents of another Python file, which returned an error message. Lastly, I received a list of files in the Atlas/executed_code directory."
