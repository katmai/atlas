I was advised not to execute the command again with the same arguments. Instead, I used the command \"get_text_summary\" with the argument \"url\" set to the Wikipedia page for Python programming language and the argument \"question\" set to \"What is Python?\". The command returned a message from my computer with an overview of Python's design philosophy, features, history, and implementations, as well as resources and references related to Python.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"write_tests\", \"args\": {\"code\": \"def add(a, b):\\\\n    return a + b\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ndef subtract(a, b):\\\\n    return a - b\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nprint(add(2, 3))\\\\nprint(subtract(5, 2))\", \"focus\": [\"add\", \"subtract\"]}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command write_tests returned: Here\\'s an example of how you can create test cases for the given code:\\n\\n```\\ndef create_test_cases(code: str, focus: Optional[str] = None) -> str:\\n    test_cases = \"\"\\n    if focus == \"add\":\\n        test_cases += \"assert add(0, 0) == 0\\\\n\"\\n        test_cases += \"assert add(2, 3) == 5\\\\n\"\\n        test_cases += \"assert add(-2, 3) == 1\\\\n\"\\n    elif focus == \"subtract\":\\n        test_cases += \"assert subtract(0, 0) == 0\\\\n\"\\n        test_cases += \"assert subtract(5, 2) == 3\\\\n\"\\n        test_cases += \"assert subtract(-2, 3) == -5\\\\n\"\\n    else:\\n        test_cases += \"assert add(2, 3) == 5\\\\n\"\\n        test_cases += \"assert subtract(5, 2) == 3\\\\n\"\\n    return test_cases\\n```\\n\\nIf you call `create_test_cases` with the code and the focus on both functions, it will generate test cases for both functions.
