Then, I used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information about Python from Wikipedia. The \"get_text_summary\" command was used to get an overview of Python's history, features, syntax, and implementations. I wrote test cases for the \"add\" and \"subtract\" functions using the \"write_tests\" command. The \"execute_shell\" command was used to list the files in the directory \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/\". I analyzed some code and removed an undefined variable using the \"analyze_code\" command. I wrote, read, appended, and replaced text in a file using the \"write_to_file\", \"read_file\", \"append_to_file\", and \"replace_in_file\" commands. I used the \"list_files\" command to get a list of files in the directory and the \"delete_file\" command to delete a file named \"my_file.txt\". I used the \"read_file\" command to read a file named \"favorite_books.txt\" and it returned a list of my favorite books."
