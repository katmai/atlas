Then, I used the \"browse_website\" command to gather information about Python from Wikipedia. The \"get_text_summary\" command was used to get an overview of Python's history, features, syntax, and implementations.

I wrote, read, appended, and replaced text in a file using the \"write_to_file\", \"read_file\", \"append_to_file\", and \"replace_in_file\" commands.
