"I was commanded to browse the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) and find out Python's philosophy. The website provided an overview of Python's history, design philosophy, features, and implementation, emphasizing simplicity, readability, and extensibility through modules. Python supports multiple programming paradigms and is well-suited for a wide range of tasks. However, the text did not provide a clear statement of Python's philosophy. I received a response from the command to get a text summary of the website, which mentioned Python's design philosophy of emphasizing readability, simplicity, and practicality, but did not provide a direct answer to the question of its philosophy. The text covers topics such as syntax, standard library, and community involvement."
