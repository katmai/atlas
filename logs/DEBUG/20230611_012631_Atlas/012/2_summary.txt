"I attempted to replace \"old text\" with \"new text\" in \"my_file.txt\" using the command \"replace_in_file\", but no matches were found. I then used the command \"read_file\" with the argument \"filename\": \"my_file.txt\" and received the contents of the file, which included the original \"Hello, world!\" line and the appended text."
