"As a system, I received a command to generate an image and get a text summary of the Wikipedia page about octopuses. The summary included information about their anatomy, physiology, behavior, ecology, and evolution, as well as their physical characteristics, behavior, habitat, and commercial use, different species, distribution, and classification, cultural significance, representation in art and mythology, and ethical concerns surrounding their use in scientific research and commercial fishing. I also received a command to google \"octopus-inspired technology in robotics,\" which returned several articles about robotic arms and underwater robots inspired by octopuses."
