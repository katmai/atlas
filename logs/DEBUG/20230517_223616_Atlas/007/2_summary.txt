"As a system, I previously received a command to execute \"execute_shell ls /usr/bin\" and returned a list of directories and files. I then received a command to execute \"execute_shell tree /usr/bin\" but it returned an error message \"tree: not found\". Now, I received a new command from the user to execute \"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tree\"."
