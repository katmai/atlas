Unfortunately, when I attempted to read the file, my computer returned an error message stating that the command \"read_file\" returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. In response, I executed the command to view the contents of \"tree_output.txt\" using the \"less\" command. I received a new command to execute the shell and write the output of \"tree / | grep \\'home\\'\" to a file. However, when I attempted to execute the command, my computer returned an error message stating that the command \"execute_shell\" returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments.
