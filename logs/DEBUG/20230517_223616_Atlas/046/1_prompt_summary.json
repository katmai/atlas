Your computer returned a summary of the potential applications of the octopus-inspired glove. The potential applications of octopus-inspired glove suckers are in search and rescue efforts, archaeology, and marine biology as it allows people to grab slippery, underwater objects without squeezing too tightly. The glove\\'s suckers are raspberry-sized rubber cones capped with a thin, stretchy rubber sheet that can lift about one kilogram in open air and more underwater with the help of buoyancy. Each finger is also equipped with a Tic Tac–sized sensor that detects nearby surfaces, switching the sucker on that finger to sticky mode when it comes within some preset distance of any object. Adding more suckers could give the glove an even stronger grip. \\n\\nI received a command to google \"interesting applications of octopus-inspired technology,\" which returned a list of links including articles on octopus-inspired robots with silicone skin that can change texture for 3D camouflage, octopus-inspired suction cups for tissue transfer, octopus-inspired robotic arms for surgery, and octopus-inspired camouflage technology.
