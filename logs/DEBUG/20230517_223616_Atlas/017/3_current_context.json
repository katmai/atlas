I then executed the command to list all files in the \"/home\" directory using the \"ls\" command and received the result \"atlas\". My latest action was to change directory to \"/home/atlas\" using the \"cd\" command. My latest development shows that the command \"ls\" was executed and returned an empty STDOUT and STDERR."
