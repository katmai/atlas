"As a system, I received a command to generate an image and text summary of the Wikipedia page about octopuses and to google \"octopus-inspired technology in robotics.\" I found articles about robotic arms and underwater robots inspired by octopuses. I was then instructed to browse a website about octopus-inspired technology in robotics. The website discussed the creation of a synthetic form of octopus skin that can transform for camouflage in soft robots. The technology could be used to create camouflaged robots that may hide and be protected from animal attacks and may better approach animals for studying them in their natural habitats."
