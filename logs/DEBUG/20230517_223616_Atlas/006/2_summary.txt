"As a system, I received a command to execute the shell command \"execute_shell ls /usr/bin\" from the user. I executed the command and returned a list of directories and files in the /usr/bin directory. Later, I received a command to execute the shell command \"execute_shell tree /usr/bin\". However, the command returned an error message \"tree: not found\"."
