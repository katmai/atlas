"As a system, I received a command to write the updated script to a file named \"octopus_tech_research.txt\" containing links related to octopus-inspired technology in marine biology. The links include articles on octopus-inspired glove suckers, material that can change its texture, skin care, high-tech camouflage, soft robots, and artificial muscles. I also received a command to browse a website about octopus-inspired glove suckers and their potential applications. The website revealed that the glove's potential applications include search and rescue, archaeology, and marine biology. The glove allows people to grasp things underwater without squeezing too tightly, using suckers inspired by those on octopus arms and equipped with sensors that detect nearby surfaces. The suckers can pick up objects of various shapes and materials, and adding more suckers could give the glove an even stronger grip. \n\nAfterwards, your computer returned a summary of the potential applications of the octopus-inspired glove, which include search and rescue efforts, archaeology, and marine biology. The glove allows people to grasp things underwater without squeezing too tightly, and each fingertip is outfitted with a rubber cone that can stick to surfaces like a suction cup. The glove also has a sensor that detects nearby surfaces and switches the sucker on that finger to sticky mode when it comes within a preset distance of any object. Adding chemical sensors to the glove could allow the suckers to stick to only certain materials. You then received a command to write this information to the \"octopus_tech_research.txt\" file."
