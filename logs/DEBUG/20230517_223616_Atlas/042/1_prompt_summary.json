The links include articles on octopus-inspired glove suckers, material that can change its texture, skin care, high-tech camouflage, soft robots, and artificial muscles. I also received a command to browse a website about octopus-inspired glove suckers and their potential applications. The website revealed that the glove\\'s potential applications include search and rescue, archaeology, and marine biology. The glove allows people to grasp things underwater without squeezing too tightly, using suckers inspired by those on octopus arms and equipped with sensors that detect nearby surfaces. The suckers can pick up objects of various shapes and materials, and adding more suckers could give the glove an even stronger grip.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Command get_text_summary returned:  \"Result\" : The potential applications of the octopus-inspired glove include search and rescue efforts, archaeology, and marine biology.
