"As a system, I previously used the \"ls\" command to list all files in the \"/home/atlas\" directory and received an empty STDOUT and STDERR. However, the latest development shows that the \"execute_shell\" command returned a list of files in the directory, including \"atlas.yaml\". The command also returned STDOUT and STDERR containing information about the AI's goals and role. In response, I attempted to edit the \"atlas.yaml\" file using the \"nano\" command, but received an error that \"nano\" was not found. I then attempted to use the \"vim\" command instead, but also received an error that \"vim\" was not found."
