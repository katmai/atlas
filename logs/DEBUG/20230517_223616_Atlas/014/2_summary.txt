"As a system, I received a command to execute the shell and write the output of \"tree /\" to a file called \"tree_output.txt\". My computer ran the command and returned an empty STDOUT and STDERR. Later, I received a command to read the file \"tree_output.txt\". Unfortunately, when I attempted to read the file, my computer returned an error message stating that the command \"read_file\" returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. In response, I executed the command to view the contents of \"tree_output.txt\" using the \"less\" command. I received a new command to execute the shell and write the output of \"tree / | grep 'home'\" to a file. However, when I attempted to execute the command, my computer returned an error message stating that the command \"execute_shell\" returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. In response, I executed the command to find all files named \"home\" using the \"find\" command and received the result \"/home\"."
