The glove allows people to grasp things underwater without squeezing too tightly, and each fingertip is outfitted with a rubber cone that can stick to surfaces like a suction cup. The glove also has a sensor that detects nearby surfaces and switches the sucker on that finger to sticky mode when it comes within a preset distance of any object. Adding chemical sensors to the glove could allow the suckers to stick to only certain materials.\nOther interesting applications of octopus-inspired technology include:\n- Octopus-inspired robots with silicone skin that can change texture for 3D camouflage\n- Octopus-inspired glove suckers that allow humans to grip slippery objects\n- Octopus-inspired suction cups that make tissue transfer easier\n- Octopus-inspired robotic arms for surgery\n- Octopus-inspired camouflage technology"
