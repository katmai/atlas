"As a system, I received a command to write the updated script to a file named \"octopus_tech_updated.py\". The script explores the potential applications of octopus-inspired technology in the field of marine biology and defines variables. It identifies potential applications such as developing new underwater propulsion systems, creating new types of underwater sensors and cameras, and designing new types of underwater robots. The script also prints potential applications. I received a command to execute the python file \"octopus_tech_updated.py\". The command execute_python_file returned potential applications for octopus-inspired technology in marine biology, including developing new underwater propulsion systems, creating new types of underwater sensors and cameras that mimic the way octopuses see and sense their environment, and designing new types of underwater robots that can manipulate objects and move through tight spaces like octopuses can. I also received a command to google \"octopus-inspired technology in marine biology\", which returned several relevant links."
