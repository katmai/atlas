However, the latest development shows that the \"execute_shell\" command returned a list of files in the directory, including \"atlas.yaml\". The command also returned STDOUT and STDERR containing information about the AI\\'s goals and role. I attempted to edit the \"atlas.yaml\" file using the \"nano\" command, but received an error that \"nano\" was not found. I then attempted to use the \"vim\" command instead, but also received an error that \"vim\" was not found. In the latest development, I received a command to execute the \"echo\" command and write its output to the \"atlas.yaml\" file, which contained information about the AI\\'s goals and role. The \"execute_shell\" command returned the content of the \"atlas.yaml\" file, which included information about the AI\\'s goals and role.
