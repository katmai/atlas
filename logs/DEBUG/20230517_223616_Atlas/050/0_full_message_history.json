The technology could be used to create camouflaged robots that may hide and be protected from animal attacks and may better approach animals for studying them in their natural habitats. The researchers took inspiration from the 3D bumps, or papillae, that octopus and cuttlefish can inflate using muscle units for camouflaging. By embedding small fiber-mesh spheres into the silicone, the scientists could control and shape the texture of the inflated surface, just as an octopus might retexture its skin. \n \n Links: ['Skip to main content (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/octopus-inspired-robots-silicone-skin-can-change-texture-for-3-d-camouflage/#sa_body)', 'Subscribe (https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/)', 'Latest Issues (https://www.scientificamerican.com/archive/issues/2020s/)', 'Scientific American (https://www.scientificamerican.com/)', 'Sign In (https://www.scientificamerican.com/account/)']"
