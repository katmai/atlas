"As a system, I received a command from you to read the file \"octopus_tech_research.txt\". The command returned information about potential applications of octopus-inspired technology, including an octopus-inspired glove that allows people to grasp things underwater without squeezing too tightly, and each fingertip is outfitted with a rubber cone that can stick to surfaces like a suction cup. The glove also has a sensor that detects nearby surfaces and switches the sucker on that finger to sticky mode when it comes within a preset distance of any object. Adding chemical sensors to the glove could allow the suckers to stick to only certain materials. I then received a command from you to write this information to a new file called \"octopus_tech_applications.txt\"."
