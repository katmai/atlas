Your computer returned an answer stating that the potential applications of octopus-inspired glove suckers include search and rescue, archaeology, and marine biology. The glove allows people to grasp things underwater without squeezing too tightly and has sensors that detect nearby surfaces and switch the sucker on that finger to sticky mode. Adding more suckers could give the glove an even stronger grip. I used the 'write_to_file' command to save the relevant information to a file for future reference. We can save the potential applications of the octopus-inspired glove suckers and other interesting applications of octopus-inspired technology to the file named \"octopus_tech_research.txt.\""
