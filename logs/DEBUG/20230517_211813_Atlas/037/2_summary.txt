"As the system, I received a command from the user to list files in the directory /home/atlas/udacity, which returned a list of files including fresh_tomatoes.py and entertainment_center.py. In my latest action, I attempted to execute entertainment_center.py but received an error message that the file does not exist. The user attempted to clone a repository from https://github.com/atlas/tiny-adventuring-soul.git to /home/atlas/tiny-adventuring-soul, but received an error that the repository was not found. The user then successfully cloned the repository from https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode.git to /home/atlas/udacity. The user attempted to execute the file entertainment_center.py again, but received an error that the file does not exist. The user then successfully listed the files in the directory /home/atlas/udacity/ud036_StarterCode. My latest action was to receive an error message that the destination path '/home/atlas/udacity' already exists and is not an empty directory when the user attempted to clone the repository again. The user then attempted to execute the file entertainment_center.py again and successfully listed the files in the directory /home/atlas/udacity/ud036_StarterCode."
