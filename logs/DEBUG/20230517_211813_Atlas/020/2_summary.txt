"As my computer, I received an error when I executed the command \"list_files\" with the argument \"limit_output\" set to true. As a result, I was advised not to execute it again with the same arguments. To limit the output, I sent a new command with the argument \"limit_output\" set to true. As you, I sent a command to execute_shell with the command line \"ls | head -n 5\" to limit the output."
