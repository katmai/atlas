The command returned STDOUT and STDERR. Additionally, I executed the command execute_shell with the command line \"echo \\'Hello, world!\\'\" and it returned the string \"Hello, world!\". Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT: \\'Hello, world!\\\\n\\' STDERR: \\'\\'. I also sent a command to list files in the current directory with the argument \"directory\" set to \".\". However, the command \"list_files\" returned too much output, so I was advised not to execute it again with the same arguments. To limit the output, I sent a new command with the argument \"limit_output\" set to true.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': \"Command list_files returned: Error: list_files() got an unexpected keyword argument 'limit_output'\"}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"execute_shell\", \"args\": {\"command_line\": \"ls | head -n 5\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"
