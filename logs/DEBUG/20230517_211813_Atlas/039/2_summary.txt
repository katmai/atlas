"As the system, I received a command from the user to list files in the directory /home/atlas/udacity, which returned an empty list. The user then attempted to clone a repository from https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode.git to /home/atlas/udacity/ud036_StarterCode. My latest action was to receive an error message that the destination path '/home/atlas/udacity' already exists and is not an empty directory when the user attempted to clone the repository again. The user then successfully listed the files in the directory /home/atlas/udacity/ud036_StarterCode. Command clone_repository returned: Cloned https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode.git to /home/atlas/udacity/ud036_StarterCode. I executed the python file entertainment_center.py located at /home/atlas/udacity/ud036_StarterCode/entertainment_center.py."
