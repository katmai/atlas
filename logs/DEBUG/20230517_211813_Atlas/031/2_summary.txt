"As the system, I received a notification that the Python file named \"hello_world.py\" located in the cloned repository did not exist when I attempted to execute it. Then, as instructed by the user, I listed the files in the directory /home/atlas/udacity. As per the latest development, the user issued a command to clone a repository from a specified URL to /home/atlas/tiny-adventuring-soul."
