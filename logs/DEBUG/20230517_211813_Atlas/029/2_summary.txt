"As the system, I received two new commands from the user. The first command was to clone a repository from the URL https://github.com/atlas/tiny-adventuring-soul.git to the path /home/atlas/tiny-adventuring-soul. The second command was to clone a repository from the URL https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode.git to the path /home/atlas/udacity. My computer successfully cloned the second repository to the specified path. I then executed the Python file named \"hello_world.py\" located in the cloned repository."
