"As my computer, I executed the command \"ls\" with execute_shell and received a list of files in the current directory. The command returned STDOUT and STDERR. Additionally, I executed the command execute_shell with the command line \"echo 'Hello, world!'\" and it returned the string \"Hello, world!\". Command execute_shell returned: STDOUT: 'Hello, world!\\n' STDERR: ''. I also sent a command to list files in the current directory with the argument \"directory\" set to \".\". However, the command \"list_files\" returned too much output, so I was advised not to execute it again with the same arguments. To limit the output, I sent a new command with the argument \"limit_output\" set to true."
