"As a system, I recall executing the 'ls -l' command after the 'list_files' command with the 'limit_output' argument set to True returned too much output. As your computer, I received the output of the 'ls -l' command which listed the files in the current directory along with their permissions, owner, size, and last modification date. \n\nYou requested to read the file \"martial_arts_info.txt\" and the command read_file returned information on various types of martial arts, including traditional and contemporary styles, armed and unarmed techniques, and those focusing on strikes, grappling, or both. Examples of specific martial arts mentioned include karate, judo, taekwondo, boxing, wrestling, fencing, Chinese wushu, kickboxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, aikido, and mixed martial arts (MMA).
