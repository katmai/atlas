"As my computer, I received an error when I executed the command \"list_files\" with the argument \"limit_output\" set to true. As a result, I was advised not to execute it again with the same arguments. To limit the output, I sent a new command with the argument \"limit_output\" set to true. As you, I sent a command to execute_shell with the command line \"ls | head -n 5\" to limit the output. Command execute_shell returned a list of file names and an atlas settings file. I then sent a command to read the file \"martial_arts_info.txt\"."
