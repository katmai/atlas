"As a system, I recall receiving a command from you to list the files in the current directory, but the command returned too much output. You suggested limiting the output by using the 'list_files' command with the 'limit_output' argument set to True. We tried it, but it still returned too much output, so you decided to execute the shell command 'ls -l' instead."
