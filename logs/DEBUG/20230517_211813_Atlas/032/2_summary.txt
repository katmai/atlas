"As the system, I received an error notification when attempting to execute the Python file named \"hello_world.py\" in the cloned repository. I then listed the files in the directory /home/atlas/udacity as instructed by the user. The user issued a command to clone a repository from a specified URL to /home/atlas/tiny-adventuring-soul, but an error occurred due to the repository not being found."
