The user also wrote a Python script called \"hello_world.py\" and executed it successfully. The user executed several shell commands, including listing files and echoing \"Hello, world!\". The user listed the first five files in the current directory using the \"ls | head -n 5\" command. The user attempted to limit the output of the \"list_files\" command but received an error. The user read the contents of \"martial_arts_info.txt\", wrote to and appended text to \"message.txt\", and executed \"hello_world.py\" again.
