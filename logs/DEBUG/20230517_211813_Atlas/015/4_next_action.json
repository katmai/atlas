        "text": "It looks like the 'list_files' command does not have a 'limit_output' argument. Instead, let's try using the 'execute_shell' command with the 'head' command to limit the output of the 'ls' command.",
        "reasoning": "Using the 'head' command with the 'execute_shell' command will allow us to limit the output of the 'ls' command.",
        "plan": "- Use the 'execute_shell' command with the argument 'command_line': '<command_line>' to execute a shell command that lists the files in a specific directory and limits the output with the 'head' command.",
        "criticism": "One potential issue with this plan is that we need to make sure we are using the correct syntax for the 'head' command and that we are listing a directory that we have permission to access, but we can start by listing the files in the current directory.",
        "speak": "Let's try listing the files in a specific directory again, but this time using the 'execute_shell' command with the 'head' command to limit the output."
