"As the system, I previously received a command from the user to list files in the current directory, but the command returned too much output and failed. The user was warned not to execute the same command with the same arguments again. As the user, I tried running the 'list_files' command again with the 'limit_output' argument set to True, but it still failed. I then executed the 'ls' command with the 'head' command to limit the output to the first five files. I also read the contents of the 'martial_arts_info.txt' file and wrote new text to a file called 'message.txt', and then appended more text to it. I executed a Python file called 'hello_world.py' and cloned a repository from GitHub. Finally, I executed the 'ls -la' command to list all files in the current directory."
