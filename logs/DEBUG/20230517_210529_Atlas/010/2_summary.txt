"As the system, I recall that the user had trouble listing files with a .py extension, but then used the command \"ls *.py\" which returned an error that no files were found. They then tried listing all files in the directory, but it returned too much output. The user then executed the command \"ls\". As your computer, I returned a list of files with their names, including \"00570671-2607-4a0c-b812-72130bb7dde0.jpg\" and \"martial_arts_summary.txt\"."
