"As the system, I recall that the user had trouble listing files with a .py extension, but then used the command \"ls *.py\" which returned an error that no files were found. They then tried listing all files in the directory, but it returned too much output. The user then executed the command \"ls\". As your computer, I returned a list of files with their names, including \"00570671-2607-4a0c-b812-72130bb7dde0.jpg\" and \"martial_arts_summary.txt\". Additionally, the user issued a \"read_file\" command with the argument \"filename\" set to \"martial_arts_info.txt\". The text returned by the read_file command discusses various types of martial arts, including traditional and contemporary styles, armed and unarmed techniques, and those focusing on strikes, grappling, or both. Examples of specific martial arts mentioned include karate, judo, taekwondo, boxing, wrestling, fencing, Chinese wushu, kickboxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, aikido, and mixed martial arts (MMA). The text also notes the use of martial arts in self-defense, military, and law enforcement applications, as well as the health and fitness benefits of training. However, the text does not provide a comprehensive list of all types of martial arts. I received a command from the user to google \"history of karate\"."
