"As the system, I received a command from the user to google \"history of karate\". I returned a list of 8 websites related to the history of karate. Then, as the user, I commanded my computer to browse the website https://www.britannica.com/sports/karate and asked \"What is the history of karate?\" My computer returned the answer that karate evolved over centuries in East Asia and was systematized in Okinawa in the 17th century by people who were forbidden to carry weapons. It was later imported into Japan in the 1920s. Karate has several schools and systems, each with different techniques and training methods. It emphasizes mental attitude, rituals of courtesy, costumes, and a complex ranking system by belt colour. Karate has some overlapping techniques with other fighting styles."
