"As the system, I recall that the user's command to list files with a .py extension returned an error. However, the user then sent a new command to execute the shell with the command line \"ls *.py\". My computer returned an error that it could not find any files with a .py extension. The user then attempted to list files in the current directory, but it returned too much output and should not be executed again with the same arguments. The user then sent a new command to execute the shell with the command line \"ls\"."
