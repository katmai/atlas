It was later imported into Japan in the 1920s. Karate has several schools and systems, each with different techniques and training methods. It emphasizes mental attitude, rituals of courtesy, costumes, and a complex ranking system by belt colour. Karate has some overlapping techniques with other fighting styles. \n \n Links: ['\\n\\n (https://www.britannica.com/)', '\\n                        Dictionary (https://www.britannica.com/dictionary)', '\\n                        Quizzes (https://www.britannica.com/quiz/browse)', '\\n                        Money (https://www.britannica.com/money)', '\\n                        Video (https://www.britannica.com/videos)']"
