"As per my latest command, I used the \"google\" command to search for reviews of Qalam wa Lawh, International House Madrid, and Berlitz language schools from reputable sources. The command returned a list of URLs, but none of them were useful. In response, I used the \"browse_website\" command to search for reviews of Qalam wa Lawh language school on the website uecmovies.com, but the website did not provide any information on the topic. I received another \"google\" command to search for the same reviews, but again the URLs were not helpful."
