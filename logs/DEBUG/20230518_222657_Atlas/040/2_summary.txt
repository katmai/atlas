"As per my latest command, I executed a Google search for reviews of Qalam wa Lawh, International House Madrid, and Berlitz language schools. The search returned several links, including those from pmi.org, uecmovies.com, and perimeter.org. I used the \"browse_website\" command to visit Google and search for reputable websites with reviews of language schools. Previously, I had used \"list_files\" to find an image summarizing my language school options at \"/home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/274e0285-b50e-4f43-9823-97c6c368e043.jpg\"."
