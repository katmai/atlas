"As per my latest command, nothing new happened. Previously, I used the \"google\" command to search for reviews of Qalam wa Lawh, International House Madrid, and Berlitz language schools from reputable sources. The command returned a list of URLs, but none of them were relevant to the search. In response, I used the \"browse_website\" command to search for reviews of Qalam wa Lawh language school on the website uecmovies.com. However, the website did not provide any information on the topic, instead discussing movies. Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The question cannot be answered using the text."
