"As per the latest command, I attempted to clone the Arabic sample program repository from the URL \"https://github.com/learnarabic/arabic-sample-program.git\" to the path \"/home/atlas/arabic-sample-program\", but received an error message stating that the repository could not be found. In response, I searched for Arabic language programs for beginners using the \"google\" command, which returned a list of websites offering such programs."
