"As a system, I received a command to browse the ESL Languages website and find out which language courses interest the user. My computer executed the command and returned a list of language courses offered by EF, with links to their main content, course finder, price request, and brochure. EF offers courses in 10 languages and 50 destinations, with options for language and academic studies abroad, as well as personalized language courses for adults and professionals. \n\nIn a recent development, my computer received a command to browse the Cactus Language website, which offers over 20 languages taught in more than 120 locations all over the world. They offer general language courses for adults, professional courses for business purposes, language plus activity holidays, and summer language camps for children or teenagers. The website also includes links to their social media pages."
