"As per the latest command, I used the \"google\" command to search for reviews of Qalam wa Lawh language school and received a list of relevant websites. I then received a new \"browse_website\" command to search for reviews on https://www.qalamcenter.com/study-abroad, which returned that the website does not provide information on the reviews of Qalam wa Lawh language school. Instead, it mainly describes the study abroad programs offered by the school in Morocco, including semester, summer, and winter programs, as well as customized and faculty-led programs. The programs emphasize language and cultural immersion, flexibility, and personalization. The text also mentions scholarships and grants available for students to finance their study abroad programs."
