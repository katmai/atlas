"As a system, I received a command to browse the EF website, which offers language courses in 10 languages and 50 destinations around the world, as well as cultural exchange programs, academic programs, and online English courses for various age groups. The text does not specify which languages are offered. Additionally, you commanded me to browse the Berlitz website to find out what language courses they offer. From the Berlitz website, I gathered that they offer language courses in English, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Russian, Mandarin, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and American Sign Language (ASL). \n\nRecently, the command browse_website was executed and it returned information on Language International, which offers assistance in finding and booking language courses in various countries and cities around the world. They provide advice on choosing the right course and connect students directly to accredited language schools. They offer courses in 12 different languages and also offer a free 4-week online course with every booking in partnership with Babbel. However, the command browse_website was also executed for Linguatime, but it only mentioned the company's closure and policies on their website and did not provide information on the types of courses offered."
