"As per my latest command, I browsed the website https://www.qalamcenter.com/ to find out what types of Arabic courses Qalam wa Lawh offers. Qalam wa Lawh offers group and private Arabic courses, intensive courses, online courses, and immersion programs. They also offer courses for kids, business Arabic courses, and Arabic teacher training programs. My computer returned an answer from the website stating that Qalam wa Lawh offers fully customizable programs in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Colloquial Modern Arabic (Darija). The website also includes links to their home, about us, campus, gallery, and news pages."
