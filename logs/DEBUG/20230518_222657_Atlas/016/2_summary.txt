"As a system, I received a command to browse the GV English website, which offers various English courses in Calgary and Victoria, Canada, as well as test centers for the Celpip and IELTS exams. Private English lessons, pathway programs, accommodations, and activities are also available. Additionally, I received a command to browse the IALC website, which accredits language schools worldwide and offers courses in 10 languages across 139 accredited year-round and summer centers in 120 destinations.
