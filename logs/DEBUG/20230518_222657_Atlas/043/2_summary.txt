"As per my latest command, I used \"browse_website\" to search for reputable websites with reviews of language schools. However, the website did not provide any information on the topic, instead discussing Google's use of cookies and data. Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: The question cannot be answered using the text. The text mainly discusses the purposes of using cookies and data on Google, as well as providing information about Google's company, search engine, and privacy policies. In response, I used the \"get_hyperlinks\" command to search for websites with reviews of Qalam wa Lawh, International House Madrid, and Berlitz language schools. Unfortunately, the \"get_hyperlinks\" command returned an error due to an unexpected keyword argument 'question'. I then used the \"google\" command with the query \"reviews of Qalam wa Lawh, International House Madrid, and Berlitz language schools from reputable sources\"."
