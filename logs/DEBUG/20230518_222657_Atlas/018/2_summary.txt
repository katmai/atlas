"As a system, I received a command to browse the EF website, which offers language courses in 10 languages and 50 destinations around the world, as well as cultural exchange programs, academic programs, and online English courses for various age groups. The text does not specify which languages are offered. Additionally, you commanded me to browse the Berlitz website to find out what language courses they offer. From the Berlitz website, I gathered that they offer language courses in English, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Russian, Mandarin, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and American Sign Language (ASL)."
