"As per my latest command, I attempted to use \"list_files\" to view the contents of my workspace, but it returned too much output and I was instructed not to execute the command again with the same arguments. Additionally, I was given a new command to execute a Google search for reviews of Qalam wa Lawh, International House Madrid, and Berlitz language schools.
