"As per my latest command, I used Google to search for reviews of Qalam wa Lawh Arabic courses. The language schools I previously saved in the file /home/atlas/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace/language_schools.txt include Qalam wa Lawh for customizable programs in Arabic, International House Madrid for face-to-face and online Spanish courses with accommodation options, programs for groups, and university pathway courses, and Berlitz for language courses in various languages for adults, kids and teens, online and in-person courses, private and group lessons, as well as corporate language training, language testing, and culture training. Berlitz offers courses in English, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Russian, Mandarin, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, American Sign Language (ASL), and other languages. My computer's command to Google returned multiple links to reviews of Qalam wa Lawh Arabic courses. I then used the command \"browse_website\" to visit the Qalam wa Lawh website and find out what types of Arabic courses they offer. Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: Qalam wa Lawh offers fully customizable programs in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Colloquial Modern Arabic (Darija). They also offer intensive Arabic courses designed to help students learn the Arabic language rapidly and with greater retention, as well as online Arabic courses. I added Qalam wa Lawh to the language schools file using the command \"write_to_file\"."
