I then executed a command to list files in the \"brno_reservoir_trip\" directory, which returned a message with the name of the text file. I tried to open the file using a command, but it returned an error saying the shell command is not allowed. An AI response provided a command to read the file, which returned information on the trail including the distance, duration, and elevation gain. I then executed a Python code to calculate the average speed required to complete the trail in the given duration, which returned a result of 2.42 miles per hour.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"browse_website\", \"args\": {\"url\": \"https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/czech-republic/south-moravian-region/brno-reservoir-loop-trail\", \"question\": \"What is the best route to take on the Brno Reservoir Trail?\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command browse_website returned: Answer gathered from website: Error: No text to summarize\\n\\nLinks: []', type='action_result'), Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"brno reservoir trail best route\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://greatruns.com/brno-czechia-brno-reservoir-veveri-castle/\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno\", \"https://greatruns.com/location/brno-czechia/\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno\", \"https://www.outdooractive.com/mobile/en/route/hiking-route/czech-republic/brno-reservoir/29020361/\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/czech-republic/south-moravian/stezka-brnenska-prehrada\", \"http://experienceeurope.eu/hiking-in-brno-my-top-5/\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno/trail-running\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
