"I was instructed to execute the command \"curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtlasCoughed/Brno-Reservoir-Trail/main/scrape_website.py\". My computer returned a message with STDOUT and STDERR information, but the command was successful and the file was downloaded. However, when I tried to execute the Python file, it returned an error due to an illegal target for annotation. I then executed the command \"curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtlasCoughed/Brno-Reservoir-Trail/main/scrape_website_fixed.py\" and it was successful with no STDOUT or STDERR messages."
