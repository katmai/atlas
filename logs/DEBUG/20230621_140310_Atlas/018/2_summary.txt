"I received an AI response to browse the website https://greatruns.com/brno-czechia-brno-reservoir-veveri-castle/ for the distance and elevation gain of the Brno Reservoir Trail, but the text did not provide that information. The website did provide information on running routes in the area, offering approximately 8 km of decent running with rolling hills, but no loop trail around the entire reservoir. The top end of the reservoir around U Sirky beach is a good area to start, and there is bus access available. Additionally, I received an AI response to Google the best route, which returned multiple links."
