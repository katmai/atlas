I calculated the average speed required to complete the trail in the given duration. I Googled the best route for the Brno Reservoir Trail and found multiple links, including a trail on AllTrails and a hiking route on OutdoorActive. I also found information on running routes in the area, offering approximately 8 km of decent running with rolling hills, but no loop trail around the entire reservoir. The top end of the reservoir around U Sirky beach is a good area to start, and there is bus access available. However, I was unable to open the AllTrails link provided due to a shell command error.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='your computer', content='Command execute_python_code returned: Requirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages (4.12.2)\\nRequirement already satisfied: soupsieve>1.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from beautifulsoup4) (2.4.1)\\n', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
