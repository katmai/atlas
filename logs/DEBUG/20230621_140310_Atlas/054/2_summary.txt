"I received a syntax error when trying to execute \"scrape_website_v10.py\". I then executed the command \"curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtlasCoughed/Brno-Reservoir-Trail/main/scrape_website_v12.py\" using \"execute_shell\" which returned no STDOUT and had STDERR messages indicating that the download was successful. I attempted to execute \"scrape_website_v11.py\" using \"execute_python_file\" but received a syntax error due to an illegal target for annotation in line 1."
