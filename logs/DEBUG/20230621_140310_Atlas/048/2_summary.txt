"I received a syntax error when trying to execute \"scrape_website_v8.py\". I then executed the command \"curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtlasCoughed/Brno-Reservoir-Trail/main/scrape_website_v9.py\" using \"execute_shell\" which returned no STDOUT and had STDERR messages indicating that the download was successful. When I tried to execute \"scrape_website_v9.py\" using \"execute_python_file\", it returned a syntax error due to an illegal target for annotation."
