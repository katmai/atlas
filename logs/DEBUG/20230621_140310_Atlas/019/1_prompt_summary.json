The website did provide information on running routes in the area, offering approximately 8 km of decent running with rolling hills, but no loop trail around the entire reservoir. The top end of the reservoir around U Sirky beach is a good area to start, and there is bus access available. Additionally, I received an AI response to Google the best route, which returned multiple links.\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[Message(role='you', content='{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"brno reservoir trail distance and elevation gain\"}}}', type='ai_response'), Message(role='your computer', content='Command google returned: [\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/czech-republic/south-moravian/stezka-brnenska-prehrada\", \"https://www.outdooractive.com/mobile/en/route/hiking-route/czech-republic/brno-reservoir/29020361/\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno/trail-running\", \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno/forest\", \"https://www.sportdistancecalculator.com/index.php?id=15082\", \"https://www.alltrails.com/en-gb/czech-republic/south-moravian/brno\", \"https://www.gotobrno.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/this-is-brno-and-its-surroundings-by-bike.pdf\"]', type='action_result')]\n\"\"\"\n"
