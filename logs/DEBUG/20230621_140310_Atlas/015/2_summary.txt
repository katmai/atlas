"I created a directory and a text file called \"brno_reservoir_trail_info.txt\" with the trail information. I then executed a command to list files in the \"brno_reservoir_trip\" directory, which returned a message with the name of the text file. I tried to open the file using a command, but it returned an error saying the shell command is not allowed. An AI response provided a command to read the file, which returned information on the trail including the distance, duration, and elevation gain. I then executed a Python code to calculate the average speed required to complete the trail in the given duration, which returned a result of 2.42 miles per hour."
