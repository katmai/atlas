The links included a trail on AllTrails and a hiking route on OutdoorActive. The website provided information on running routes in the area, offering approximately 8 km of decent running with rolling hills, but no loop trail around the entire reservoir. The top end of the reservoir around U Sirky beach is a good area to start, and there is bus access available.
