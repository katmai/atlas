"I received information on the distance, duration, and elevation gain of the Brno Reservoir Trail from a file. I calculated the average speed required to complete the trail in the given duration. I Googled the best route for the Brno Reservoir Trail and found multiple links, including a trail on AllTrails and a hiking route on OutdoorActive. I also found information on running routes in the area, offering approximately 8 km of decent running with rolling hills, but no loop trail around the entire reservoir. The top end of the reservoir around U Sirky beach is a good area to start, and there is bus access available. However, I was unable to open the AllTrails link provided due to a shell command error."
